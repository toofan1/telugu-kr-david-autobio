The Family of My Grandfather, a Man of Sacrifice

My grandfather, a noble man of sacrifice, had three sons and two daughters. The eldest of his children was my father, Ramayya, who was a reflection of my grandfather in both appearance and strength. He was a handsome man with a radiant complexion and a hardworking nature.

When he came of age, he married Smt. Rajamalla, also known as Rajamanemma, from Ellamala-Vasanthapur. True to her name, she shone like a gem among women. She carried herself as a devoted wife, seeing her husband as a god. She was hospitable, selfless, and a model housewife, transforming the home into a heaven on earth. As a blessed mother, she earned a reputation of honor, and to this day, her children rise up and call her blessed, as the verse from Proverbs 31:28 says.

My parents’ married life was like a flowing river, filled with many noble adventures and achievements.

They were blessed with six children—three sons and three daughters.

The greatest gift of all is the gift of knowledge, and though my father had no formal education, he recognized this supreme truth and was determined that his children should be educated.

Around 1910, Pastor Benjamin visited my father. From the very first encounter, Pastor Benjamin poured the life-giving message of the Gospel into his ears.

Even while my father was plowing the fields, Pastor Benjamin would stand by with a Bible in hand, teaching him the Gospel. In that field, the Bible and the plow moved side by side, with Benjamin speaking the Word into my father’s ears even as he toiled. Those who saw this were amazed.

Through this constant teaching, my parents accepted Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, and were baptized by Pastor Benjamin. They became members of the church in Sharajupet. My father’s name, Ramayya, was then changed to “Rajarathnam” and registered in the Sharajupet Church records.
