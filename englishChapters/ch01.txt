Chapter 1


There are some hard truths in history.

You may not be able to believe them. Your belief is of no use to them.

They are steadfast truths.

These truths, like the stars in the sky, will guide you. Even if you don't want to, you must walk the path they reveal.

There are days when such hard truths emerge.

One of those days is Sunday.

Sunday holds a special place in history.

What happened that day?

In the East, swords blossomed. Darkness trembled and scattered away in all directions. The earth shook violently. In a garden with a grave, an earthquake erupted, and the ground split. The gates of heaven opened with a loud sound, and an angel descended from the heavens.

He rolled away the stone covering the grave entrance, as if it were a wheel, and sat upon it. Seeing the radiant face of the angel, the world was astonished.

What happened in that grave?

To cleanse the earth of sin and to pave a royal path to the heavens, He conquered death, rose alive from the grave.

Who?

From untruth to truth

From darkness to light

From death to life,

Christ, the Son of God, who took upon Himself the mission to guide this world and granted salvation to the physical world for the first time.

The resurrection of Christ is that hard truth I mentioned at the beginning.

Just as it is true that a seed must die to sprout, so is the resurrection of Christ, who defeated death and rose alive, equally true.

On that same Sunday—a day of welfare for the world—I was born.

That is, I was born on Sunday, March 25, 1917, in Tanguturu, Bhuvanagiri Taluka, Nalgonda District. This place is near the Aleru and Janagaon railway stations.

The blessed souls who gave birth to me were Mr. Kallepu Ramayya and Mrs. Rajamanemma.
