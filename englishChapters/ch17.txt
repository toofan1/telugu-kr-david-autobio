Chapter 17

Even though such revival waves were coming to Warangal, I did not leave my job. As soon as duty ended, I had no other focus. Going to "Faith Home," immersing myself in prayer with fellow workers.

In one prayer gathering, I wept much about my future. Will that future be bright? Or dark? What is God's prophetic word about it?

At such a time, a prophecy was revealed through Brother Christudasu:
“My son, David! You want to remain a bachelor. That is not My will. Through marriage, you must serve Me. I have prepared you for the salvation of many. I am going to use you that way. This is the word of Jehovah!”

Who did this prophecy come from?

From someone newly arrived from Kerala, with whom I wasn’t well acquainted—furthermore, the thoughts of my heart were completely unknown to him.

He belonged to the Vaishya caste.

His salvation was also recent.

That Christudasu spoke the hidden meaning in my heart’s quest about the future—what else can that be but God’s word?

Whatever it may be, I stored that prophecy in my heart.

“Marriage is honorable in all things,” says the Bible (Hebrews 13:4).

Even so, my focus did not turn in that direction.

Circumstances were pressing forward in a certain way.

Previously, a couple—Kottapalli Jonathan and his wife—who were working in the Baptist mission, were saved by God's leading and embraced the Pentecostal Holy Spirit truth.

As a result, a great storm broke out.

The Baptist mission gave an ultimatum to Jonathan's family: vacate the house they had provided and leave.

It wasn’t just them—many other parents who received the Pentecostal experience were being dismissed from mission jobs.

Not only that, but their children were also being expelled from mission boarding schools. Those children, driven out, wept, saying, “Oh Lord, what path is left for us?” Carrying their boxes on their heads, dropping out of school, they returned to their homes.

Unable to confront Pentecostal truth with Baptist doctrine, those mission leaders undertook such an unjust path.

Among the unfortunate children expelled from mission boarding was Jonathan’s daughter—Leelamma. Thus, one whole year of her education was lost.

But she received the divine education that surpasses all others. Her parents would take her to Pentecostal meetings along with them. In attending such meetings, the Holy Spirit filled her. Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, she received many spiritual gifts. At the age of 14, she was saved. From that moment, she began to shine as a blazing flame.

This was the promise given to her by God:

“He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; He seats them with princes, with the princes of His people. He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children.” —Psalm 113:7–9

For all those children cast out of mission boarding homes, a trained teacher was found—like a great banyan tree giving shelter.

That was Mr. G.B. Samuel.

He had an order from the District Education Officer to run a school in any village in the Warangal district.

Should he run the school for the sake of salary? Or should he uphold a life of faith and teach the children of Pentecostal believers who were expelled from school?
A great crisis stood before Samuel Pantulu.

But he chose the life of faith. That, too, was the Holy Spirit's prompting. Because of this, he became lovingly remembered by all the believers’ children as “Samuel Pantulu.”

Like this, many people faced fiery trials. In those trials, all of them achieved victory.

I too faced such a trial. As soon as I received salvation, all the plans I had made for my future were canceled. The desire to become a doctor was replaced by an interest to become like Sadhu Sundar Singh.

I was then being swept away in the great outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
Through His Spirit, through visions, the Lord kept speaking repeatedly.

Like a bell, His words kept striking in my heart:

“You must preach the gospel.”

From the time I was baptized and became a disciple of Christ, I had to obey Christ’s words no matter what challenges came.

This was a burning fire in my heart!

As soon as duty ended, I would go along with Brother Paranjyothi—speaking in villages, on verandas, on crates—preaching and giving testimony. We filled the surroundings of Warangal and Hanmakonda with the gospel.

In our evangelistic work, I was invited to teach the children of Muslim landlords in Timmampet, near Ghanpur station.

While teaching those children, my life remained tied to the Warangal fellowship. Thus, one year passed in my life after salvation.

At this time, a Swedish devotee named Carlsson met me by chance and said,
“Brother David! You must set out for the Lord’s service. The Lord is calling you to His service. You must dedicate yourself.”

So on one side, I was being called to dedicate myself fully to gospel ministry.

On the other hand, the sorrow of my parents had not subsided. They were eager to marry me off and throw me into the ocean of household life.

I was waiting in tearful prayer for the Lord’s answer.
