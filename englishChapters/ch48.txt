Chapter 48

In 1953, the Rajahmundry temple was completed.
On the day of the temple's entrance, believers felt it as the gate of heaven and stepped inside; their joy and happiness had no limits.
This temple became a dwelling place for believers and turned into a magnet attracting outsiders towards it.
In the place God granted favor, they first built the temple and, to reside there, erected a thatched hut with palm leaves and proclaimed the full gospel.
Hundreds of people came into salvation. Many servants of God dedicated themselves; some joined the Zion Bible School, while others stayed right with David Ayyagaru and received training in service.
In the year 1954, the meetings took place very blessedly. Young servants enthusiastically put up pandals, arranged food materials,
and cooked and served meals themselves to those who came. From the villages, hundreds of believers from area churches began to come.
In 1955, the New Year worship took place very grandly.
As soon as dawn broke, again to this godly couple, on January 7th, Ebenezer Joy was born.
The church believers and family members themselves built a house for me. This is a house built with indigenous help. In this house, the fifth son Daniel (Babi) was born on October 18th.
Thinking that Ebenezer Joy would be the last delivery, and that up to now God alone had helped, they named him Ebenezer. As the godly people thought, there were no deliveries for five years, so they considered Joy the youngest. However, God again gave a delivery—Daniel was born. They looked after him with great care.
When Daniel was born in the new house to the man of God, the man of God was not at home.
Along with the new house for the man of God, a new vehicle—that is, a Royal Enfield motorcycle—was gifted by the godly woman Lina McGuire, who belonged to Britain.
Taking it and coming home, because of the son God granted favor and because of the vehicle, they greatly praised God.

To further develop the already growing service, this motorcycle traveled hundreds of miles, expanding the area work.
Previously by foot-walking, on ox-carts, on train cars, on buses, on bicycles—now on a motorcycle—they did service.
In 1961, the convention began. God performed mighty works. Along with indigenous devotees, the foreign devotee Dalhousie Flemings delivered divine messages; many were blessed, many received salvation.
This very gentleman performed the naming ceremony for the little one born as Daniel.
