Chapter 2

Every person’s life is naturally imprinted by the conditions of the time and place of their birth and the traditions of their lineage.

Just as it’s impossible to separate the glory from God, the moonlight from the moon, or light from a lamp, it is also impossible to separate these influences from a person.

Therefore, I will first describe the conditions of the time and place when I was born and then discuss how the traditional influences of the Kallepu family, who gave me birth, left their mark on me.

At that time, all of India was suffering under British rule, while the state of Hyderabad was under the Nizam’s administration. There is no doubt that the British rulers empowered these local monarchs to suppress people who sought freedom.

The Nizam’s full title was “Ala Hazrat Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur Saheb Kul Dulmulmulk Sultanate.” The name “Nizam State” originated from this title. The state was divided into 16 districts and 4 subdivisions, and the lives of the people were filled with tension under the rule of Muslim administrators.

At that time, the voices of Andhra’s millions of Telugu speakers were silenced. Just as the Israelites suffered under Egyptian oppression, the Telugu people were divided into five parts: one in the Arava region, one in Orissa, one in Karnataka, another in Maharashtra, and a part within the Nizam’s rule in Telangana. The people’s growth had halted, and one section of the Telugu population in Telangana was under Muslim rule.

The history of Telugu at that time was as bleak as the pre-Christian history of Palestine, where the Roman rulers divided the small land into four provinces, with Judea being one of them under King Herod.

The people back then dreamed of a Messiah to deliver them from oppression, just as the people under the Nizam’s rule yearned for a leader to free them from his administration.

The towns and villages were filled with resentment among the non-Muslim population. Urdu was the official language, and those who spoke it held high social status, while the rest were marginalized, with no one to care for them.

The Nizam had a private railway called the “Nizam State Railway” and even minted coins with the “Charminar” symbol. The state had its own postal services, police, and customs offices to levy taxes on travelers coming from “British India.” A British Resident, supported by a special army funded by the Nizam, monitored the state closely.

People’s living conditions were terrible. Officials constantly exploited the rural villagers, demanding bribes from poor farmers and laborers at every turn. These bribes were called “Nazrana,” and refusing to pay meant one’s life became unbearable. Authorities would break into homes and take whatever they wanted, including livestock. Women, too, suffered under these unjust practices.

In villages, there were officials called "police patels" who abused their power. It was as if these officials were wolves preying on the poor, regardless of their religion. Landlords and village heads alike feasted on the weak, treating people as if they were merely playthings.

In the late 19th century, a severe famine struck, and it wreaked havoc on an already struggling population.

The suffering people, with nowhere else to turn, prayed fervently for a savior. Their prayers were answered, and a ray of hope shone in the darkness.

This hope was the light of the gospel.
