Chapter 23

The Antarvedipalem Bible School lasted for 37 days. From many regions, enduring the blows of the August movement, many people, after experiencing various hardships, came. Through those who came there, we came to know about the matters of the Zion Bible School, and all the sufferings we had previously endured were easily shattered.

This school was started with faith in God, without any foreign aid. Nevertheless, the allowances of each day were paid on that very day. Every day, meals were served like feasts — up to 150 people came to the school. This was set up in the coconut groves of Antarvedipalem itself. The night classes would be like great assemblies. Listening to the sermons, hearts would be shaken, some would cry, some would beat their breasts, crying and crying, and attain repentance, and others would be filled with the Holy Spirit.

Thus, on the final day of the Bible school, 69 people received baptism. One can imagine how large a number this was in those days. Truly, it was a marvelous and eye-pleasing wonder.

The school was completed. With the strength of its blessing, we once again reached "Eemani."

Leelamma’s time for delivery approached. Who would assist her in childbirth?

We prayed, we prayed. The Lord graciously provided guidance. I took Leelamma to Vijayawada and put her on the train — to her parental home in Warangal.

After sending her off, I climbed Gandhi Hill, which lies to the west of the station. Amidst the ruins there, I did fasting prayers for three days. I had no companions then. No food or drink. No sleep to fill my eyes.

Only God was with me. In those three days of fasting and prayer, the Lord strengthened and blessed me. After concluding my prayers, I went to the "Faith Home" in Islam Pet and received care from Mrs. P.M. Samuel Amma.

Later, again, the journey to "Eemani." At the Krishna Barrage slope, the bicycle slipped and fell. I received serious injuries to my head. Yet, the Lord protected me that day.

However, after reaching "Eemani," it felt as if I might die.

In that weakness, the article I wrote under the title "The Letter Christ Wrote to the Sardis Church" was published in the November edition of "Suvartha Prakashini."

In that article, I explained the letter warned in Revelation 3:1 — "You have a name that you are alive, but you are dead."

I expressed my heartfelt wish there: "Let us live with Christ as our foundation, attain our name in the book of life, white garments, and glory before the Father's presence!"

This article opened the curtain to my literary life. Many praised it, saying, "This article taught the duty of revival to the churches traveling toward a dead condition."
