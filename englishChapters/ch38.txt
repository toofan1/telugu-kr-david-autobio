Chapter 38

The year 1948 brought a new turning point in my literary ministry.
The work titled “Yugamulu” (Ages), which gained me remarkable recognition throughout the entire Andhra region, was serialized in Suvartha Prakaashini.

The inspiration to undertake the writing of “Yugamulu” came from the Saturday-Sabbath Mission people. Without discerning the movement of the wheel of time, they were going back to the Age of the Law that existed before the Cross and, distancing themselves from grace, were promoting the doctrines of the Saturday Mission. It was precisely to refute this error that I took up Yugamulu as a counter-argument.

They fail to observe the truth:

“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son… through whom He appointed the ages.” (Hebrews 1:1–2)

Just as spokes belong to a cartwheel, ages belong to the wheel of time.
The sixth age of the rolling wheel of time is the Age of Grace.

Living in the Age of Grace, yet clinging tightly to the earlier Age of the Law, refusing to stretch out their hands to receive the divine grace of the Age of Grace—glory and eternal life—such blind devotees are these Saturday missionaries.

Ages can be determined according to the manner in which God cooperated with humanity in each period. From Adam onward, Scripture has divided world history into seven divisions. These are called the seven ages.

When we hear the word “ages,” Hindus may recall the Krita, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali yugas. But these ages are different—these are the ages that reveal the will and redemptive plan of God.

Those seven ages are:

The Age of Innocence

The Age of Conscience

The Age of Human Government

The Age of Promise

The Age of the Law

The Age of Grace

The Age of Blessedness

The Age of Innocence

From the creation of Adam until the fall into sin—when the first humans, instead of obeying God’s word, bowed to Satan’s word, and God expelled them from Eden—this period may be called the Age of Innocence.
The Bible does not specify how many years this age lasted.

The Age of Conscience

From Adam’s fall until the Flood. According to God’s will, Noah built an ark to be saved from the coming flood, and through that ark all living creatures were preserved, while the entire world that failed to heed God’s purpose perished in the flood. With that destruction, the Age of Conscience came to an end.
This age lasted approximately 1,656 years.

The Age of Human Government

From the Flood until the call of Abraham. After being saved from the ark and coming out, Noah offered sacrifices to the Lord God. God smelled the pleasing aroma and made a covenant with Noah, saying that He would never again destroy the world with a flood (Genesis 9:10–17), and He granted Noah and his descendants authority to govern the earth.
But they acted contrary to God, undertook the building of the Tower of Babel, and resisted God. When God scattered them at Babel, the Age of Human Government came to an end. Even in this age, humanity did not obey God.
This age lasted approximately 4,127 years.

The Age of Promise

From the call of Abraham until the giving of the Law at Sinai. God chose Abraham, blessed his descendants, and made a covenant with him, promising to give the land of Palestine as an inheritance to his offspring. In this age Abraham was called the friend of God.
This age ends with the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt.
Its duration was 480 years.

The Age of the Law

From the giving of the Law at Sinai until the crucifixion of Christ. At Sinai, God said to Moses:

“I carried you on eagles’ wings and delivered you from Egyptian bondage. If you obey My voice, I will love you above all peoples.”

Thus God graciously gave the Law and dealt mercifully with humanity. But rejecting the Law given by God, the Israelites demanded a king. Those kings divided the land God had given, ruled as two kingdoms with Samaria and Jerusalem as capitals, committed sins as recorded in the books of Kings, and incurred curses. They were exiled for seventy years, disobeying all covenants.
Though God showed mercy and sent the Messiah, they chose Barabbas and cried, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” and finally crucified and killed the Messiah.
With this, the Age of the Law ended.
This age lasted approximately 1,500 years.

The Age of Grace

From the crucifixion of Christ until His second coming. The Age of Grace began at the Cross. God bestowed grace and truth through Christ. This grace flowed forth as forgiveness of sins. Whoever believes in Christ can obtain salvation—this is a great age.
This age has been continuing for about 1,080 years and will end at His second coming.

The Age of Blessedness

From the second coming of Christ begins the Age of Blessedness—an age in which righteous rule will prevail for a thousand years.

The Spirit of Grace of the Age of Grace was poured out on the day of Pentecost and continues even today, filling many people and causing the Church of God to grow day by day.
Only the spiritually blind fail to recognize this truth.
