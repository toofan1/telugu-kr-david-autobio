Chapter 36


After that, yet another change of house for us.
Where to now?
It felt as though we were being sent to some so-called “heavenly dwelling.”

We were moved into a house that looked as if it had been soaked in salt and could collapse at any moment.

That house was of no use to anyone—unfit for habitation, in a completely dilapidated condition.

And that was where we made our home.

Watching our household life and these repeated house-shifts, it felt as though we were moving from smoke into heat.

In truth, that is exactly what happened one day.

On December 31, 1947, my five-year-old child Evangeline caught fire when a hut ignited and was badly burned.
At that moment, Sadhu P. G. Joseph rushed in, lifted the child immediately, extinguished the flames, and saved her.

In caring day and night for the burned child, my Leelamma lost all sleep and food.
The eye that had been damaged in 1942 now deteriorated completely.
How long would these sufferings continue?

Even in the Lord’s service, the toils increased.
There was no inner satisfaction of the soul.

That same year, I began ministry in Pasivedala village.
It was only by the Lord’s special leading that I set foot in Pasivedala.

When one got down from the train there, it looked like a tiny roadside stall.
Only one or two passenger trains would stop in those days.

From then on, I began walking frequently through the streets of Pasivedala, proclaiming the Gospel.
Those who gave me hospitality, honored me, and helped me were:
railway employee D. Picchayya, K. Shantamma, and D. Sundarrao.

Thus, revival flames arose in Pasivedala.
On Sundays, I would conduct worship in Rajahmundry from 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., then run at exactly 9:20 to the Godavari station to catch the train.
Many times I ran along the railway tracks behind the moving train itself.
If I missed the train, I would miss the service, and the spread of the Gospel would be hindered.

In that urgency, after getting down at Pasivedala, I would move about without caring even if my clothes were ruined by mud.

The revival flames that arose in Pasivedala spread throughout Kovvur taluk as well.
With His wondrous glory and power, the Lord performed many great works.
Hearing of these, many from surrounding villages began to say in amazement, telling story after story, that God had come down and dwelt in Pasivedala.

This was the moment—we had to spread these flames even further.
As long as there was strength, until the sinews in my legs wore out, as long as breath remained in this voice, the Gospel had to be taken to more villages.
Fertile ground can yield harvest. Such readiness had come into the villages.
This opportunity must not be let slip.

So, starting from Rajahmundry, I proclaimed the Gospel not only in Pasivedala but also in Kovvur, Jaberangabad, Vemuluru, Togummi, Chagallu, Nidadavolu, Malakapalli, and other villages.
Believers came along with me in groups. After serving, by the time we reached home it would be 12 midnight, sometimes 1 or even 2 a.m.

Early in the morning, the believers had to go to work.
They were all poor, and because of their faith they suffered much harassment—from family members, in-laws, or parents.
Yet, in the very name of Christ, they found joy even in those persecutions.
Without fearing those hardships, they pressed forward courageously, burning with zeal for service.

At night, after the ministry ended and the others returned home, I would often sleep on the Pasivedala railway platform, and many times on the Kovvur platform, waiting for time to pass.
That night, somehow, I had to reach home.
If I did not, I would be wronging my wife, who—until I reached home—would not even drink water but would spend the time in prayer, encouraging my ministry.
At daybreak, whether by launch or by train, I had to reach Rajahmundry.
When I arrived and saw my wife Leelamma praying for me, I would be filled with amazement.

Ah! How can I adequately praise that godly woman—mother of three children, yet constant in prayer?
With folded hands and tears poured out before God, she herself gave birth to the Pasivedala church through those very tears—Leelamma.

Thus, the year 1948 dawned.
Though the new year brought blessings into our faith life, it also brought a great calamity into our family life.

What was it?

News came of a terrible accident to my father, whom I loved dearly.
Strong bullock carts knocked him down and trampled upon his chest.
His heart rose to his throat—his life was in grave danger.
On hearing this news, the anguish that seized me cannot be described.

But the wonder-working Lord Jesus—
He came as the protector of our household, brought deliverance, and healed him.

Praise be to the Lord!
