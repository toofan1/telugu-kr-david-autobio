Chapter 18

If one thinks one thing, they say God thinks another — elders say God's thought is supreme.
According to that thought, everything must happen inevitably!
That beginning — March 15, 1940.
Morning rays were spreading and blooming.

In that pure radiance, as a symbol of the Holy Spirit’s faith,
a grand celebration took place that day in the Warangal Pentecostal Prayer House.

In pastor’s attire, P. L. Paranjyothi and P. M. Samuel
appeared in the temple.
Crowds thronged the temple — it couldn’t hold the multitudes.

A wedding ceremony was taking place.

Swedish missionary Mr. T. Bilson also attended this celebration.

Whose wedding bond?

Between K. R. David and Leelamma.

Mediator — Mr. Paranjyothi.
Under the supervision of Mr. P. M. Samuel.

Samuel and Bilson gave profound speeches that day.
All the attendees were moved deeply.

Our marriage was spoken of as unusual.

The wedding happened according to Pentecostal faith.

No mangalsutras, no ornaments, no flower garlands —
everyone was surprised!

What was there? Only faith!

While everyone called it strange,
devout believers and angels sang praise and blessing songs with joyful melody,
and the wedding took place grandly.

What about our parents? Our uncles who kept nagging "marriage, marriage" until that day —
what about the relatives' strength?

Not a single one came.

The Pentecostal doctrine, with its radical interpretations,
had likely reached their ears —
that there would be no jewelry, no mangalsutras, no flower garlands —
the Baptist community had spread such rumors.

Because of that, the leaders of that community
did not allow our relatives, our uncles, or our parents to attend the wedding.
There is no doubt this was the influence of religious orthodoxy.

Even though no one came,
the wedding happened magnificently.

David, who had resolved to remain celibate for the Lord Jesus,
became a householder according to God’s will.
He took his Pentecostal wife
and went directly to Janagaon and Tanguturu.

As the light shone in his eyes,
and innocence radiated on her face,
pure like a washed pearl,
Leelamma bowed
and saluted her in-laws.
