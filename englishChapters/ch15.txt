Chapter 15

Trials and Accusations

However, trials soon followed. Letters filled with accusations were sent to my parents.

What were those accusations?

I was accused of being completely consumed by the great revival!

"Your son, David, is no longer with us. He doesn’t listen to us, nor does he share our concerns. All he talks about is God, divine meditation, and the Holy Spirit! He keeps shouting ‘Praise the Lord!’ and ‘Hallelujah!’ as if he’s lost his mind. If you don’t intervene soon, he will either become a saint or a monk and be lost to you forever!"

Indeed, it was true! I had come to realize that medical service alone could not bring salvation. I had turned away from that path, believing that leading the physically and spiritually afflicted towards the Lord was the greatest service—one that brings true salvation. Like Sadhu Sundar Singh, I had decided to dedicate my life to serving Christ.

I firmly believed that the blood of Christ alone can cleanse all humanity from sin. His sacrifice on the cross had opened the graves, bringing forth the righteous. His blood had healed even lepers, and the stain of sin upon the world had been wiped away. His crucifixion had flung open the gates of heaven, paving a royal path between earth and the divine.

Who could stop a traveler ready to walk that path?

My Family’s Attempt to Stop Me

In an attempt to bring me back, my uncle and father traveled from Janagam to Warangal to see me.

Instead of resisting them, I took them along to a Pentecostal meeting. There, they heard the hymns, the stirring music, and the powerful cries of Hallelujah! and Praise the Lord! They witnessed firsthand the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the worshippers.

Overwhelmed, they too immersed themselves in the sacred flood of worship, washing away all their previous doubts.

At that moment, my father turned to my uncle and asked,
"Brother-in-law, what is wrong with this?"

The response he gave changed even my elders. Seeing the transformative power of the Pentecostal movement and the Holy Spirit, I could do nothing but bow in reverence to God’s divine inspiration.


A Moment of Conviction

My uncle spoke with conviction:

"Yes, this is the same life that should be in our churches as well! People are weeping in repentance, changing their hearts, beating their chests in sorrow for their sins, and longing for the Holy Spirit. They are praying with tears. If our boy has joined them, what is wrong with that?"

Hearing these words, my father nodded in agreement.

The meeting ended.

As we walked back to my place, it was around 10:30 PM. We were discussing the Holy Spirit when I suddenly felt a strong prompting from within. Overcome by divine inspiration, I hugged my father and, without hesitation, pulled the tobacco packet from his pocket and threw it away.

Shocked, he protested:

"You’ve been a Christian all your life, a leader in the church, and yet you still haven’t given up this God-forbidden tobacco?"

My father, taken aback, responded:

"Oh no, wait! Let me just finish this last one, and then I'll quit."

I stood firm:

"That won’t do! Salvation isn’t something to be postponed. The time for salvation is NOW!"

And with that, I threw the tobacco away.

That was it! From that very day, my father never touched tobacco again—not for the rest of his life, a full thirty years.

After this life-changing experience, my father and uncle returned to Janagam.

Opposition and Threats

However, there were still some who refused to accept the transformation. The worm of doubt and opposition had burrowed deep into their minds.

They tried every means possible to intimidate and threaten me into submission.

But they failed. They could not shake my faith.


A Family’s Resistance and a Divine Encounter

In the end, some elders came together and advised my father:

"If you get him married, his spiritual enthusiasm will cool down."

Since they lacked deep spiritual experience and had no real concern for their children’s faith, my parents fell for their deceptive words.

Meanwhile, my elder brother, Abraham, opposed the revival teachings and preachers. He even wrote letters urging me to stop attending meetings and return home.

But none of this affected me. Except for the name of Christ, everything else felt as insignificant as chaff.


An Attempt to Bring Me Back

A few months later, my brother-in-law, J.B. Samuel, came to Warangal to try and persuade me.

We had been childhood friends since 1925, and he hoped that his familiarity with me would make me surrender.

But this faith is not like worldly beliefs—

Just as it is impossible to separate light from a lamp or fragrance from a flower, so too is it impossible to separate faith from a true believer.

He didn’t understand this.

At first, we exchanged pleasantries, but according to my usual practice, I invited him to a revival meeting.


A Damascus Road Experience

He had never seen such a gathering before.

He had never heard such powerful, thunderous gospel preaching—

It was like the roaring of mighty waters!

He had never experienced sermons that struck the heart like lightning and shattered the soul like a hammer.

Just like Paul fell blind before the divine light on the road to Damascus,

My brother-in-law was completely undone before the Pentecostal revival!

Until then, he had never truly understood the meaning of salvation.
If he had never known salvation, how could he have understood the experience of the Holy Spirit?

That very night, he accepted this new truth, repented, and committed himself to follow Christ!
