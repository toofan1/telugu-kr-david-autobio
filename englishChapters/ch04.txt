Chapter 4

The Fearful Times and the Spread of the Gospel

Back then, there was fear everywhere—fear of life itself. Life was unbearable, burdened by oppressive village officials, cruel patels, and the autocratic rule of the Nizam.

Pastor Benjamin was the one who introduced the divine remedy for these burdens and all sins: the name of Christ.

Not only was he a deeply devout man, but he also possessed remarkable skill with weapons like swords and sticks. He had a strong, robust physique, was a talented singer, and an excellent orator. When he preached, he brought Christ to life. He had a fervent desire to teach his disciples all his knowledge and skills, tirelessly working toward this goal. Many were astonished by his dedication. He always kept a New Testament in one pocket of his coat and a book of Psalms in the other. With an umbrella in hand and sturdy shoes on his feet, he would walk from village to village, proclaiming the Good News.

After living for some time with his wife Jennamma in the village of Choudaram in the Janagama area, they were guided by God to move to Sharajupet, located between Aleru Railway Station and Jeedikallu.

From there, they spread the light of the Gospel to villages like Sharajupet, Tanguturu, Kolluru, Shaigudem, Mandanapalli, Gundlagudem, Kallem, Jeedikallu, Golnukonda, Manthapuri, Nagaram, and Pembarti.

All of this was done on foot. He was selfless, humble, deeply devoted, and concerned for the well-being of the people.

In rural areas, he brought the light of knowledge to people who were struggling in the darkness of ignorance. He helped them understand the truth.

Inspired by his admirable love and compassion, my grandfather, grandmother, and many others wholeheartedly accepted Christ. While they reached the shore of the river of life, they didn’t venture deeper than knee-deep waters.

Nevertheless, as followers of Hinduism and practitioners of Sanatan Dharma, they grew up worshipping idols, revering monkeys as Lord Hanuman, and cobras as Nagas. It was no small matter for people from this background to embrace the universal message of Christ, which was vastly different from their previous beliefs.

My grandfather, Maisayya, was a respected village elder, wealthy in livestock and harvests, and led a prominent life as a pillar of the village. A tall and imposing figure, his conversion to Christianity was an act of courage—one can imagine what a bold step it must have been.
