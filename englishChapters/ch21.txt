Chapter 21

Our Gospel preaching in Vijayawada — first happened mainly in the slum areas where the lowest Dalit castes lived.

Railway quarters, Udpet, Gavarcherupet, Pet, Israelpet, Moghalrajpuram, Giripuram, Nizampet, Bandarupet, and other such neighborhoods became playgrounds for our Gospel work.

In this (preaching), joining us was a brother from Udpet, Meesala Moses —
he was doing a job but still participated in our preaching,
and he was a great believer serving widely in Guntur district.

In this way, for about six months, the people of Vijayawada tasted our service.
Many praised our word ministry, tireless preaching, and the sacrificial way we lived.
I say this not to boast — but a true Christian’s life itself, if lived as an ideal, strengthens the impact of their teaching on people.
If your way of life is not right, no matter how precious your words, there will be no one to listen.
It is to say this that I am recalling our work in Vijayawada.

Later, following the elders’ advice, we settled at Gandigunta, near Uyyuru.
From there, we served in Uyyuru, Kunduru, Neppalli, Kankipadu, and other villages — all by foot or on bicycles!

The hardships we experienced there are beyond description —
hunger, lack of clothing, and other suffering —
but no matter how many difficulties came,
we should not reveal our hardships to others —
to do so would be a grave insult to God.

There was no other way but to pray to God to remove our troubles.

God, through His Spirit, revealed our hardship in the church prophecy at Warangal!
"My church! My beloved servant K.R. David, who went to serve Me in Gandigunta, along with his wife and children, are suffering without food and clothing. Send them help!" — so it was prophesied.

The Warangal church wrote that prophecy to me in a letter and sent it.
Even though no material help came, that comfort helped us greatly —
it gave great satisfaction,
reminding us that we have a loving Heavenly Father caring for us.

When my wife Leelamma, who didn’t even have a decent cloth to wear, saw my torn clothes,
she came to me with tears and said:

"Dear! Seeing your tattered clothes pains me so much!
Look, I will tear apart the edges of the mill-cloth saree my parents gave, and stitch underclothes for you.
Please use it in the meantime,"
thus she filled that lack.

When our Heavenly Father above, and my wife at home, showed me such affection —
what shortage did I have?

But in Gandigunta, at that time, the Communist movement was just beginning.
Those longing for India's independence were leaving the Congress party and joining the Communist movement.

Among them, Harijans and Kammas were being made to drink water from the same vessel,
eat meals in the same row,
and when lower castes served the food, the upper castes were happily eating —
People were thrilled, saying, "What greater humanity, brotherhood, and equality can there be?"

— To declare the Gospel among them? What a difficult task it was!

Still, I dared.
When I preached about salvation in Jesus Christ,
about the blessedness in the love of the cross,
some Kammas, along with Harijans, united and stoned me and persecuted me.

At such a time, I remembered Stephen.

Stephen was not only a full believer but also full of the Holy Spirit!

Thus he performed miraculous works —
many who were sick were healed even by his touch.
People of earth were astonished by his glorious deeds.

He was a man rich in wisdom.

Those who could not defeat him in wisdom, cowardly dragged him outside the towns and stoned him to death.

He became the first martyr!

The blood he shed lit up this hardened society with the flame of consciousness.

"Am I greater than that noble martyr?" —
thinking thus,
I laid my bloodied head at the Lord’s feet, and comforted my sorrow.

At times, we received comfort from believers like Dr. T. Yesudas, Mrs. Mantada Maryamma, Dr. Esther David, and others.

According to the verse,
"Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me," —
when I received such comfort at Vijayawada,
I bore all persecutions, determined firmly to glorify the Lord,
and stayed at Gandigunta, and served through sufferings in Uyyuru.

No! Not I alone — wasn't my Leelamma also with me?

Another trial faced us.

We went to Warangal and Tanguturu on leave.
At Warangal, Grace, our daughter, caught a cold.
In that cold, she developed double pneumonia, and on January 29, 1942, the child fell asleep in the Lord.

This was a most discouraging event at the beginning of our ministry.

Though I bore all persecutions from non-Christians,
the death of my child crushed me.
Adding to this grief were the accusations of our relatives,
saying, "You killed the child by not giving medicines,"
which became an even sharper blow.

"My daughter has died. What need is there for me to live?" —
immersed in such an ocean of sorrow,
at the altar near the Warangal Bitu Market,
Leelamma gave a testimony about Abraham’s sacrifice, when God asked him for his only son Isaac.

That testimony stirred my heart.
The words she spoke calmly became life to me, like life returning to the dead.
Her words were strengthened by divine power.

Thus, comforted,
we returned to Gandigunta without our daughter.

How heavy was that grief?
