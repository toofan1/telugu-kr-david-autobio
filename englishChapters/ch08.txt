Chapter 8


The festival of Muharram arrived. It was a ten-day celebration. Although it was primarily a festival of the Muslims, in Telangana, since the rulers were Muslim, almost ninety percent of non-Muslims participated in this festival as well. This was seen as a way for the people to show their loyalty to the rulers. To feed the "Aluva" bonfire, a vast amount of wood, branches, and shrubs were gathered and burned. For ten nights, hundreds, sometimes thousands, of Hindus circled the fire with sticks and swords, leaping and dancing with intense joy and enthusiasm.

At that time, I was 14 years old, and I too participated without fail in those celebrations for all ten days. Whether it was a game, a song, or a performance, I was always at the forefront, never in the background.

On the final day, all the young men threw their decorated sticks and wooden swords into the fire to burn them. Some tried to save their beautifully decorated swords, but I took the initiative, gathering everything and throwing it all into the bonfire. While doing so, I accidentally slipped and fell into the fire.

Thinking I was doomed, those around me panicked, terrified, not knowing what to do. I had no way out of the fire, and blisters began to form on my legs.

In that moment, it felt as if Jesus Christ Himself extended His hand and pulled me out. When I looked around, no one was near me. My left leg and right hand were burned and covered with blisters, yet I ran home without telling anyone and began to wash the burns with water. But the burning sensation didn’t subside.

Morning came, and though I hoped that no one would find out about this mishap, my plan failed. My mother was the first to notice.

“Oh, David, what a terrible accident!” she cried, weeping and wailing. Soon, my father too learned of the incident.

The pain from the burns was intense, but another worry plagued me—the fear of what my father might say, as this injury would prevent me from helping with the farm work.

Unable to walk due to the pain on one side, and unable to eat with my burnt right hand on the other, the challenges kept mounting.

Each day, my younger sister Mary fed me. When I was 11 years old, we used to fight constantly, sometimes even fiercely. But the bond of blood overcame everything, and in that difficult time, my sister became very close to me. For almost two months, while I suffered with my wounds, she fed and cared for me in countless ways.

In my farming days, I had yet another close encounter with danger—this time, a water accident, from which the Lord saved me.

Whenever they had a chance, my older brothers would teach me how to swim. For those who couldn't swim, water accidents were a constant risk. At first, I'd shout angrily at them in fear, but they taught me with patience and care.

One day, my younger brother Jacob and our cousin Devadanam started swimming in a large well. They were inexperienced and, after some time, exhausted in the middle of the well. They began to drown, grabbing each other and swallowing water, on the brink of death. When I saw this, I panicked but leaped in to help them. In such a crisis, even a blade of grass can seem like a lifeline to the drowning. As soon as I jumped in, both of them clung to my neck, pulling me down. Now, all three of us were headed toward the depths, facing certain death.

But suddenly, the distant shore came within my reach. I don't know how I got there. Sometimes we dismiss such things as mere coincidences, but they are acts of divine grace. The Lord who provides for the frog in the rock and the fish in the water knows exactly what to do.

It was that merciful Lord who led me safely to the shore, of that I am sure. I believe He pushed me to safety.

Why am I so certain of this?

I can confidently say that He saved me that day because He intended to use me in His service in the years that followed.

That loving Father saved me not only from fire and water but also from charging bulls, poisonous snakes, and many other dangers. He is the only Lord on this earth who can rescue the helpless, the forsaken, and sinners.
