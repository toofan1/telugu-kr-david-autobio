Chapter 28

With the blessing-strength that came as a result of prayer on the Warangal Fort,
a great change occurred in the course of my life.

There were two pastors in Warangal.
Rajahmundry is like the heart of Coastal Andhra.
Many reform movements originated and developed from here.
The root man of these reform movements was Veeresalingam Pantulu garu.
Moreover, in the field of literature, the town of Rajahmundry is the jewel crown of Andhra Pradesh.
The famous Mahabharata, known as the fifth Veda, was translated into Telugu by Nannayya Bhatt here itself.
This is the birthplace of the modern novel, history, drama, and farce in Telugu.
It is a town embraced by the Seven Hills.
Because the Godavari River flows swiftly here,
the Konaseema below has become a land of gems.

To such a historically important town,
the elders of the church had a determination —
to spread the fire of the Holy Spirit.
Though for a year already, the Malayalam sisters —
Annamma Mammen as leader, along with Rojamma John, Chinnamma, Maryamma, and Kunjamma — were working,
no immediate results were seen.

Therefore, they decided:
a pastor should be sent from Warangal to Rajahmundry.

Whom to send?

My turn came.
They resolved that the one to send should be K.R. David,
who had determination, dedication, and independence in service.

At that time, Evangeline was 3 years old,
Thomas was a one-year-old child.
With two children and my wife, leaving behind relatives,
to a town 800 miles away from our birthplace,
a town whose face we didn’t even know,
we were ready to set out.

Place? – unknown.
Congregation? – none.
Supporters? – none.
Coworkers? – none.

Who was there then?
Only the Lord —
the One who had called me by name to His service — was with me.

We had already fasted and labored in Warangal.
I came with the strong inner assurance that no place could be more destitute than Warangal.
Though young in age, Leelamma strengthened her husband in courage,
in practice, in giving counsel,
in doing ministry,
and in enduring the many hardships of service —
in all these, she was a matchless partner.

After praying in the presence of the Lord,
casting all our burdens on that Creator of the universe,
and with firm determination,
on Tuesday, June 26, 1945,
we set out by train.

Church members, relatives came to the station and gave us a farewell.
They prayed.
They sang songs.
They shouted slogans that echoed in all directions:
“Victory to Christ the King!”
Amid those cheers, the train began to move.
Until the train left the platform, the praises and cheers did not stop.
All the relatives and friends who had come to send us off
returned to their homes with tear-filled eyes.

Sitting in the moving train,
I drew the children and my wife close to me
and suppressed the tears that had reached my throat.
The children were little, we were young servants,
there were no elder brothers of mine there —
for everyone and everything, God alone was our refuge.

By the time I reached Rajahmundry,
the Malayalam sisters who had been serving there
had left to Tadepalligudem,
unable to bear various difficulties.

That house was now vacant.
It belonged to Mr. Thallari Alangayya Janu.
We unloaded our belongings from the ox-cart,
placed them in the house, prayed to the Lord,
and afterward cleaned the house for our new household
and arranged our things.
We cooked something and ate.

Dr. Mrs. Peters’ father, Dr. T. Yesudasu,
came, visited us, encouraged us, and left.
Mr. A. L. Jonah, Mrs. Alamuru Mariyamma,
and some believers came and gave us supplies and money.

Since it was wartime, strict rationing was in force.
That ration wouldn’t even be enough for half a fortnight.

That rationing indirectly harmed me.
The believers, on Sundays, felt troubled
even to give an offering of rice —
wasn’t that a difficulty for them?

Days kept rolling by.
Time itself does not show mercy on seeing our struggles.
But the One who can show mercy —
is Jesus the Lord.


“While these sufferings were going on, there were even greater sufferings.”
In the town of Rajahmundry in those days, the doors for the full Gospel were closed.
If one set out with the Bible in the morning, no Christians would allow entry inside.

Everyone had submitted to religious formalities.
If someone spoke of repentance, they would argue that it is only written in the Bible, but there is no one who has received it.
Their opinion was that devotees were wolves in sheep’s clothing. This is also true—
Many deceptions were taking place in those days under the name of devotion.
Those who claimed to be saved had fallen into sin and became subjects of reproach.
Wherever one went, there was no ministry taking place.
Congregations had become bloated like Sodom and Gomorrah.

Our life had become even more difficult than that.

“Whether they listen or not, you must proclaim to them so they will know that a prophet has been among them”—
Recalling this verse, Jeremiah 2:4,
I began our ministry with unshakable faith.

Rajahmundry, Katheru, Utlalanka, Konthamuru, Kolamuru, Gadala,
Bommuru, Hukkumpeta, Dhavikeshwaram, Vemagiri, Rajavolu, Kondagunturu,
Pashivedala, Chagallu, Sampadanagaram, Kovvur, Malakapalli and many other villages—
I was one who preached the Gospel, to proclaim Christ.
I myself carried the drum and the light.

Visiting these villages again and again, when my feet were swollen,
Leelamma's service to me is unforgettable.

Because she had received a special prayer gift from God,
no matter how many days she fasted, she never told others.
She never took loans.
Her patience in steering the boat of life with discipline is ever memorable.

“Give us this day our daily bread”—the prayer the Lord taught,
That is what we would follow, selflessly.

In the meantime,
I did not give up my literary efforts in facing the challenges
that the Baptist missionaries hurled at the Pentecostal movement.


In the Gospel Light (Suvartha Prakashini) of September and October 1945,
the answers I gave to the questions of the American Baptist Deccan Association in Janagam were published.
I will mention here a few important questions and the answers I gave to them.
These answers can serve as responses for all kinds of times and situations.

1. Why are you not working among non-Christians, and instead visiting only Christians?
Answer: We are declaring the Gospel equally to both Christians and non-Christians.
However, when we go to the non-Christians, they say: “First correct your Christians.”
They call “Lord, Lord,” but do not do the will of the Lord.
They say they know God, but by their deeds, they deny Him. (Titus 1:16)
So doesn't the Lord desire that the Christians first turn back from their fallen state to the right path?

2. Why are you giving a second baptism, opposing your mother denomination, the Baptists?
Answer: We are not opponents of the Baptists.
We are true Baptists.
Didn’t your Baptist pastor once give someone a second baptism and say this is the real one?

3. Are Pentecostals working hard only to increase church membership?
Answer: We are not concerned with numerical strength.
If that were the case, by now the numbers would have increased to tens of thousands.

4. Why do you show such aversion toward jewelry? Is it a hindrance to salvation?
Answer: Genesis 35:2–4; Exodus 33:3–6; Deuteronomy 7:25; Isaiah 3:16–26;
Hosea 2:13; Zephaniah 1:8; 1 Timothy 2:9; 1 Peter 3:3–6; Revelation chapters 17 and 18—
if all these are read one after another, it is evident that God abhors these things,
and those who adorn themselves with them are detestable to Him.
Because all ornaments are considered idols of foreign gods,
we are casting them away.

5. Are not mostly bad people joining your fellowship?
Answer: Yes. The self-righteous do not need salvation.
So, just like in the time of Christ, now also tax collectors and sinners alone are being saved.
“There is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.” (Luke 15:7)

6. Aren’t you doing this work for your belly’s sake?
Answer: There is no way to separate from the belly! The belly is also with us.
Even so, we have no worry about what we will eat.
“The Lord, give us our daily bread”—He is everything to us.
In the midst of enemies, He is preparing a table for us.
