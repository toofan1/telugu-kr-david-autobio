Chapter 16

A Pentecostal Storm in Warangal and Hanamkonda
This mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit spread like wildfire across Warangal, Hanamkonda, Dornakal, and beyond—

It shook both the living and the non-living!

Baptist Missionaries’ Resistance
The long-established Baptist missionaries grew increasingly anxious and enraged.

They launched desperate efforts to stop this movement.

But could their frustration and anger extinguish the blazing fire of the Holy Spirit?

These flames do not just glow—they erupt like mighty volcanoes!

Crowds swelled to hundreds and thousands.
This revival was delivering souls from a meaningless life of worldly pleasures
and leading them to the divine promise of eternal life.

Who would crave rotten husks when a feast of divine abundance is set before them?

Unlike the lukewarm service of the Baptist missionaries,
this movement was alive with the fire of revival.

Witnessing the Power of God
Even Hindus, Muslims, and Parsis came to our gatherings.

They marveled at the mighty works God was performing in our midst.

The Baptist Mission’s Strategy Meeting
The Baptist missionaries were blinded with jealousy.

At that time, Miss Mary Studd was the head missionary overseeing Warangal and Hanamkonda mission fields.

She gathered a council of Baptist leaders at the Warangal mission church.

Their agenda: "How do we put an end to these new preachers and their teachings?"

Realizing that our presence would only provoke them further,
I, along with Pastor P.M. Samuel, Brother P.N. Paranjyothi, Brother Christudasu from Kerala, and several sisters,

earnestly prayed for a new place of worship.


The Divine Grace Overflowed Like an Ocean
During this time, retired railway station master E. Anandarau Garu,
being inspired by God, offered his own house near Puppalagutta, Warangal,
for Pentecostal prayers and gatherings.

At that place, continuous fasting prayers were held for ten days.

Why these fasting prayers?
The Baptist missionaries had devised plans
to suppress this new fellowship, its ministers, and the revival movement.
But our goal was to destroy their schemes and experience God’s victory!

A Divine Vision to Pastor P.M. Samuel
During that time, the Lord granted many visions and signs.

One of them was extraordinary and revolutionary—
a divine vision given to Pastor P.M. Samuel Garu.

A radiant ball of fire
descended from the sky
and rested upon his head.

As soon as it rested, it shattered into fragments,
and those fragments burned brightly, spreading in all directions!

This fire was a symbol that the Pentecostal movement, like a revival flame,
was about to spread across the entire nation—a revelation from the Lord.

The Pentecostal Experience—A Vision That Opened Our Eyes
Ten days after Jesus’ ascension,
on the day of Pentecost, when the disciples gathered in one place,
a mighty sound came from heaven,
and a tongue of fire appeared.

That fire rested upon each disciple
in the form of flames.

What we had read in the Scriptures,
we now witnessed with our own eyes—an astonishing experience!

What Appeared as a Tiny Spark in 1939
Has Now Spread as a Global Pentecostal Movement.

For this, we wholeheartedly praise and glorify God!
