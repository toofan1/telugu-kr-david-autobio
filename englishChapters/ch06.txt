Chapter 6


Among our parents' six children, the eldest is Abraham, born on December 1, 1912; I was born on March 15, 1917; Mary on January 8, 1920; Jacob on March 25, 1924; Sharamma on February 12, 1980; and Vimala on November 15, 1986.

Our father, Sri Ramayya, had two more sons, Reuben and Joseph, along with my brothers Jacob and Abraham. However, Reuben and Joseph both passed away, resting in the Lord at just one year of age.

Here, it’s only fitting to mention the Lord's marvelous plan of salvation and protection.

In 1920, our father, known as Rajarathnam, fell gravely ill. His lungs were severely damaged, and doctors warned he wouldn't survive long, saying his fate was sealed. However, due to continuous prayer, he regained his health and lived on, reaching a full lifespan of 55 more years in good health. It was his faith in Jesus, the great healer, that spared us from becoming orphans, as the Lord saved him.

Our second brother-in-law is Sri L. Priyanatham, married to our sister, Srimati Sharamma.

Our younger brother-in-law is Sri K.C. Das, married to our sister, Srimati Vimala.

Our prayer bore fruit. In that prayer, we pronounced Christ’s name with faith. We learned how much divine power exists in the name of Christ, who sacrificed for all our sins.

Again, in 1920…

When our father was steering a cart, he had to descend from a height as tall as a toddy tree into a valley. While he tried to hold the bullock's rope to stop the cart, since it was a heavy cart, he couldn’t bear the weight and the bullock rope, and he fell under the wheel. For a while, his breath even stopped.


For the helpless, God is the only hope. At that moment, only the Lord was there to save our father, and He protected him from that life-threatening situation.

To say that the Lord saved our father for our sake is by no means an exaggeration.

Our father endured numerous hardships for the sake of our education.

In those days, Telangana faced hardship; the lands depended solely on rain. Relying on such lands, our father worked tirelessly day and night, striving for our education. He sold a profitable herd of goats, as it hindered our education, and instead bought cows.

There were no rains for seven years. There was no water even for the cattle, and the crops that promised a harvest withered. With a household to sustain, unbearable debts, and a situation where mere survival was difficult…

In 1925, they sent my brother Abraham and me to study under Pastor Benjamin at Sharajupeta. Benjamin, who bestowed a new life on our grandparents and parents, was our teacher. What greater blessing could we ask for?

To Sharajupeta, our father would take us along with other children for Sunday worship. When Benjamin garu (sir) would speak the word of God face-to-face, the joy we felt was immense. For these services, our uncle G. Buchayya would also come with his family from Kolluru. Though we were children at the time and did not fully understand the depths of Christian experience, the Sharajupeta service felt like a festival to us. Every Sunday was a celebration. We eagerly went to Pastor Benjamin's school in Sharajupeta, leaping with excitement, and along with us, Buchayya Mama's children, G.B. Samuel and Jacob Wilson, also came to study. In truth, that was not merely a school for learning but could be regarded as a gurukula (place of learning) that instilled great culture within us.

Along with education and values, they also taught games, songs, and stick fighting.

Vasantapuram is 8 miles from Tanguturu. That is our maternal uncles’ village, and there were constant exchanges between the two villages. There was closeness among relatives. In Vasantapuram, our maternal uncles, and in Tanguturu, our parents believed in the Lord Jesus, and by the time we came to understand, they were living in devotion to the Lord.

With relatives, our family always stayed lively. Though our father was given the name Raja Ratnam after receiving baptism and believing in the Lord Jesus, everyone in the village affectionately called him Ramayya or Ramanna. As a respected elder among the village leaders and a farmer among farmers, he received honor from everyone – our father.

Seeing our blessed family, the landlords in the village respected our father as a zamindar (landowner).

In my childhood, my mother fell ill due to a rat bite. The famine in the country brought many difficulties upon our family.

At that time, my brother Abraham was a shepherd. He had to take the goat herd to the forests and bring it back after grazing. Only one who loves the herd can tend to it. I also learned to tend to the herd. If I avoided going with the herd, punishment awaited.

After herding the flocks, our education began. Occasionally, we would also study at our uncles’ house in Vasantapuram.

Meanwhile, in 1926…

In Janagam Mission. I got the opportunity to join the boarding school in 8th grade. Among us brothers, one had to stay with our father to help him. When one stayed, the other would study. According to that rule, this year, the chance to study came to me. Isn’t this God’s grace!

In that mission school, there were two divisions: primary and secondary. Miss French, an American missionary, was the head of the primary division. She ran the school with great skill. For students in grades 1-4, she would provide clothes, sweets, and feasts while enforcing strict discipline. She would punish anyone, regardless of age, without any hesitation.

Mr. G.V. Samuel and I studied in the same class. Since his parents were mission workers, he came from the mission quarters. At that time, I was 10 years old.

In this boarding school, there were also boys aged 15-20 who studied. These older boys would make us cry in various ways. Despite Miss French treating us kindly, loving us with affection, and giving us many gifts, due to the threats from the older boys, I decided not to return to boarding school the next year. No matter how much a farmer works—there will always be weeds in the field! In this way, it happened to me as well.

1927 arrived, and the schools reopened. That year, it was my elder brother's turn to study.

But for some reason, my father ordered me to prepare for school. Even though I pleaded, "I don’t want to study there," my father was very determined about my education. Just as a mother makes a child drink milk even if it resists, my father forced me. Left with no choice, I left my family, whom I dearly loved, my parents, and my friends, and went to Janagam. My father accompanied me to comfort me. I had to join the 4th grade.

Actually, the 4th grade of those days was of a very high standard. Rev. Charles Rutherford was the principal of the Janagam missionary school.

My father tried to console me, saying, "What’s this! After coming such a long way and joining boarding school, you're crying because you don’t want to stay? We are not expecting you to uplift us by studying; it’s for your own benefit.” But my decision didn’t change.

In the mission school, my father introduced me to active people like Venkataratnam Pantulu, who taught carpentry. Yet, I didn’t stop crying. My decision remained unchanged.

While the wise elders said not to waste such a golden opportunity and that education is a "third eye," my playmates admired me for having given up studies.

Thinking that I could roam around the village with my playmates if I avoided the troubles of school, I faced a great trial.
