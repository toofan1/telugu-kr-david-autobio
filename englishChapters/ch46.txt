Chapter 46

While this was happening, on April 6, a demon possessed E. Shantamma.
When Christ, along with His disciples, set foot in the Gerasene country near Galilee,
immediately a man of that village who had a demon (appeared) before Him:
Understanding that this demon-possession was due to the unclean spirit's instigation,
Christ, being filled with the glory of the Holy Spirit, was able to command the unclean spirit within him to come out.
As soon as it heard that command, the unclean spirit within him trembled violently and fell at His feet.
Because of this, for the glory and power of the Holy Spirit, I undertook fasting and prayers.
Because of this glory's influence, the unclean spirit that had entered Shantamma must flee in terror.
Day by day, my prayer continued with dedication.
The compassionate Lord caused His Holy Spirit to shine forth.
As seven days were about to pass, the unclean spirit in Shantamma trembled, came out, and fled away. Shantamma became peaceful.
That very day I went to Dhavileswaram and bargained for bricks for the prayer hall.
They quoted Rs. 388-00 for a cartload of bricks. But
Dhavileswaram bricks seemed good to me. I firmly settled them at Rs. 34-00 per thousand and
the troubles I faced for lorries were not small. One lorry I spoke to was under repair. Somehow it had to reach Rajahmundry. With that determination, that night I slept right there on the brick kiln at Vemagiri ghat. But those bricks did not reach Rajahmundry even after ten days.
In this way, the Lord helped me in the construction of the prayer hall.
On one side, purchasing materials for the prayer hall and transporting them to the construction site,
on the other side, the work of collecting details continued day and night without pause.
If we start the work—should it not continue until completion? Otherwise, wouldn't it be loss in every way?
Along with preparations for the prayer hall construction and gathering its financial resources,
I did not stop the ministry of the Word at all. On April 28, when the Pamarru Convention began, I left from Rajahmundry for those meetings.
P.L. Paranjyoti spoke on “Donkey - Ox” in the meetings, and I preached on “Gifts.”
Paranjyoti's idea was that one should not yoke a donkey and an ox together for plowing.
As soon as my sermon finished, I again got on the bicycle, went to Gangavaram,
took a car, reached Rajahmundry, and from there went to Kovvur and spent time in collecting funds for the temple. In that effort, exhausted, I reached home.
Again early morning, taking Apostle P.M. Samuel who had come to Rajahmundry for those meetings, I set out for Pamarru. That
night, i.e., on the 23rd, P.M. Samuel and I preached.
To say how powerfully our sermons went—if we take the number baptized in the Pamarru meetings, that is enough—
49 people were baptized in those meetings. We delivered the message of Christ's salvation to thousands of people gathered. These meetings were held under the leadership of Pastor K.G. Palugaru.
Again coming to Rajahmundry, I immersed myself daily in gospel service.
The Lord's grace was shining on me like full moonlight. In the month of June, the Lord did many more great works through me. For Pasivedala prayer hall, I purchased 10 cents of land for Rs. 450-00. In this we consecrated the temple. For this, I, D. Sundarrao, Yona, M. Purushotham
stayed up working until 7 o'clock at night.
While staying awake, I felt as if I was living together with the Lord.
His gracious glances rained upon me like rays of moonlight; with that joy overflowing, I reached Rajahmundry.
From Rajahmundry I went to Bhimavaram, participated in the English worship there,
came to Waltair, and bought a ticket to Godavari station. I paid Rs. 3-50 for the ticket.
Four more days later, i.e., on the evening of June 25, 1950, at 4 o'clock,
my Leelamma gave birth. In her womb, “Ruth, blessed by Jehovah,” was born.
