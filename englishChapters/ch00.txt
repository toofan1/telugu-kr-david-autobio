Foreword

“Your testimony has remarkable lessons. They greatly contribute to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, write your autobiography and make it available to the Christian world,” many friends repeatedly urged me.

This task is not easy. Writing an autobiography is challenging. It must not have room for self-glorification, nor should one shy away from self-criticism. It requires courage to reveal hard truths. An autobiography must hold a mirror to one's life, serving as an example for others.

Only one with a testimony that can serve as such an example is worthy of writing an autobiography. Many authors who have written numerous books have not written an autobiography because they lack this qualification. I am no exception to this; however, the Lord has inspired me. “For My glory, undertake this effort,” He urged. Thus, any benefits that arise from this autobiography will be for His glory alone.

Let all Christian believers receive this as a testimony of my experience in service to the gospel.

In this endeavor, my poet friend, Mr. Padala Rama Rao, supported me. I cannot refrain from expressing gratitude for his help in organizing all my diaries, meticulously reviewing my notes, and shaping this autobiography into literary form.

I also offer my heartfelt thanks to the evangelistic brothers and friends in faith who encouraged me to undertake this work.

This is the first part of my autobiography. I hope to release the second part soon.

Yours in service of the Lord, A servant of the Lord, Rajahmundry
