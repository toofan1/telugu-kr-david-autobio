Chapter 43

At the same time, we moved into another new house.
It was a large house belonging to a man connected with the Lutheran Mission.
It was situated beside the Rajahmundry Jampeta Electric Sub-Station.
It was a big house, with a monthly rent of Rs. 30.

The troubles caused by the owner of that house are beyond description.
From the very first month after renting it, he waged a constant battle demanding that we vacate the house.
Day after day he would come, abuse us, threaten us, and leave.
At times, people in khaki uniforms would also come in support of him.
Behind his threats and bullying, I sensed a hidden hand at work.
What else could it be but burning jealousy?
Here was someone who had come alone from far-off Telangana, and with just three or four others had turned many people toward the Full Gospel!
At such a sight, what could arise except inner rage?

Their desire was to weaken our Spirit-filled revival ministry.
If one is not a madman, can anyone cover the sunlight with a blanket and stop it?

Rajahmundry was going through a severe housing shortage at that time.
Wherever we searched, a house simply could not be found.
The landlord’s agents came every single day, hurling abuses.

“What should we do?” we asked the Lord Himself.

Some advised us to leave the town.
They said, “There are no houses available here—go elsewhere.”

“But God Himself has sent us here.
Unless God tells us to leave, we will not go.
We will not hesitate even to lay down our lives as nothing for the sake of this town,”
my Leelamma replied to them with fervor.

For six months, the owner of that house tormented us like a saw cutting through wood.

Following the proverb that says one should stay far away from the wicked,
we finally decided to vacate that house.
Just then, by the grace of the Lord, we again found a house in Danavaipeta, this time belonging to a Muslim man.

Thus, within two years, we were forced to move seven houses.

The hardship we endured because of rented houses over those two years
is known only to those who have experienced it.
Such suffering—we would not wish even upon our enemies.
