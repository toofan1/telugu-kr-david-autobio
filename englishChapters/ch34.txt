Chapter 34

Summer came.

For some reason that year, wherever one looked, only fire accidents were seen.

In just the two months of April and May, if in Rajahmundry town 3000 houses were burnt to ashes, one can understand the horror of those fire disasters.

People, each carrying some possession, were running in all directions in terror, trying to save themselves from those flames.

The owner of the house in Danavaipeta where I was living, Alam Gayya Janu-garu, had an old house in Lakshmivarappupeta. That too was burnt down. From there, with his belongings and children, he came and fell upon my house, and quarreled with us saying we must vacate the house.

What kind of injustice is this? His house getting burnt — what of it? But to fall upon my house and forcibly make me vacate — what is that?

Where should I go?
The whole town is burnt down!

With no choice, on May 8 we vacated that house and shifted to another small thatched-leaf hut in Kambalapeta. That house belonged to a nurse named Kamalamma. As we entered the house and were arranging books and belongings, suddenly a scorpion stung me. Its pain was unbearable. When Kapa Ludiamma and my Leelamma prayed, by the Lord’s mercy peace was restored.

From the very day we entered that house, wonders began.
On Thursdays and Saturdays there was no real meal at all. Not only I and my wife but children too were there. They could not bear hunger. Not a coin in hand. How would food come? I considered all this as the Lord’s testing.

1947, May 11, Sunday…

Day of worship.

There was hope that if worship took place, some offerings might come, and thus hunger might be eased a little.

But what use?

Even that day’s worship faced hindrances. The main persons who were to come made excuses — saying either there was no church building or the time was unsuitable — and did not come. Earlier I had rebuked them concerning church order and the faith that was growing lukewarm. Perhaps because of that they did not come.

Christ the Lord said — the poor are blessed. Only those poor believers came for worship. Some offerings, some rice were gathered. Worship ended.

When the believers went away to their homes, Leelamma, burning with hunger, went into the kitchen and touched the stove.

Outside — great commotion!

Just two or three yards from our house, a hut caught fire. That very mid-afternoon, fifty houses burned to ashes before our eyes. Each person, carrying what belongings they could, was running with beating hearts toward safer places.

Where could we go?

Only four days earlier we had come to this house. We did not even know where our belongings were. We were fasting. As food was being cooked, again — a fire accident!

With whatever things we could grab, we ran.
Ludiamma ran with a bundle of old clothes and a stool.
Leela ran carrying the children and books.

At the same time — looters!

Is it not natural that during riots, calamities, and dangers, robbers enter?

Pretending to help, they stole a wristwatch and some belongings.

After some time the fire brigade came. As usual, only after the houses had already burnt down did that force make its appearance. Still, that too was some good. After much effort they put out the flames. Our rented hut alone did not burn. The surrounding huts were all destroyed.

Truly that was divine grace!
The Lord kept us alive.
We brought back the belongings lying on the road, and ate the half-burnt rice in the house to ease our hunger.
Small and big things all lay in heaps.

By then darkness fell — night, 7 o’clock.

Just then, a fierce wind — impossible to stand against.

In that wind, ashes and burning embers from the burnt houses flew up and were falling on the remaining houses. Everyone, crying aloud in panic, began fleeing again.
Flaming embers were falling in heaps — how could we survive this danger?

The one who could make us survive — was Christ the Lord. Thinking thus, I, Leelamma, and Ludiamma began praying with tears:
“Lord! From this fiery deluge, save us and the poor of Kambalapeta, O Father!”
Crying loudly, we continued.

A cool wind blew.
We lifted our eyes and looked — our joy knew no bounds.
Our prayer was answered.
Dark clouds gathered, and from the sky poured down a torrential rain.

Jehovah, who once appeared to Moses in the burning bush, appeared to us that day in the showers of rain.
He cooled the flames, touched the heavens with His hand, opened their sluices, and poured down streams of rain.

Praise be to God who heard our prayer!
To that ocean of mercy, the Lord who came to us like a pillar of cloud in the dreadful dark night and gave us peace — what can we offer to repay His grace?
