Chapter 44

The year 1949, a New Year, arrived.

In the New Year I made the following resolutions:

To walk with God like Enoch.

To meditate daily on the Cross, and to pray to understand the measure of Christ’s love.

To wait daily for the filling of the Holy Spirit.

To bear witness daily to others about salvation.

To help poor brethren.

To proclaim the Word in season and out of season, to cooperate with those who proclaim it, and to pray for God’s servants.

I began to practice these disciplines with double enthusiasm.

As a result, I conducted revival meetings vigorously in Rajahmundry.
From January 6 to 9, these meetings were held, and Pastors P. L. Paranjyothi and T. S. Uppotu delivered the Word of God.
Believers were blessed.
On the final day of the meetings, eight persons believed in the Lord and received baptism in the river Godavari.

At this time, I also had to face the severe fiery trials that confront believers in Christ.
Mission leaders, alarmed at the blaze of the Pentecostal movement, with the encouragement of certain priests, disrupted our gathering, beat me brutally, and publicly humiliated me.

History testifies that such persecutions and humiliations are natural consequences.
Did not the great Apostle Paul, when he entered the city of Philippi and ministered the Word, provoke the jealousy of certain leaders, who stirred up ruffians and had him beaten in the public street with iron rods?
Was he not then thrown into prison by the magistrate, like tying up a calf because the ox resisted the goad?
And yet those servants of Paul knew nothing except the name of Christ.

And what happened afterward?

Did not an earthquake occur, shaking even the foundations of the prison?
Did not the chains with which Paul and Silas were bound suddenly snap and fall to the ground?

At that time, that servant Paul became a model to me.
In those persecutions, the one who showed compassion and gave comfort to Paul was a woman—Lydia.

In the same way, the one who comforted me while I was being beaten was also a woman—who was she?

My wife!

Filled with the Holy Spirit, once again meetings were held in Rajahmundry from March 30 to April 1, and again the Lord blessed our movement as six persons received baptism.
At these meetings, Pastors P. M. Philip, P. L. Paranjyothi, and Sadhukochchu Kunju were present and ministered the Word of God.

Since the work of the Lord was growing day by day among the young believers, and since it could no longer be handled by the shepherd who had been there until then, once he left,
I appointed G. Isaac and his wife Kemparatnam, bringing them from Uyyuru, to take his place.

The Gospel began spreading to many regions.

While we had been crying out to the Lord daily for the past four years to remove the suffering caused by rented houses, in this very year, on December 10, the Lord poured out His gracious rain upon our family.
Through Pastor P. M. Samuel, the Lord enabled us to purchase the site that is now famously known as “Faith Home.”

The extent of this land was 505 square yards, and I purchased it for Rs. 2,200.
On this site, we built a small thatched house and began to live there.

Immediately after purchasing this land, I appealed to all believing friends to contribute toward the construction of a prayer hall.

As a result, the Rajahmundry church members immediately pledged Rs. 1,000.

Ah! How wonderful is the Lord!

Praise be to the Lord!
