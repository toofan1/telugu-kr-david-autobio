Chapter 10

In 1934, the first step of my journey passed by happily. Isn’t that a strange new wonder?

From that point, my school life became burdensome. The heavier it felt, the more my thoughts wandered. Gradually, the days began to feel endlessly long.

I became separated from my family and distanced from my loved ones. Joining my peers, I began slipping step by step into a life of sin.

What a terrible mistake, what a grave sin it is! Without committing any serious crime, I found myself abandoning the parents who loved me like their very breath, my brothers, and my sisters.

At this time, questions began ringing in my little mind like the sound of temple bells:
“Will I attain salvation if I die? Or will I end up in hell?”
“What is going to happen to my life?”

These questions made my head burn with confusion. In that heat of turmoil, I passed the V form and arrived at Tanguturu.

It was there, in Tanguturu, that I faced the consequences of my sinful ways: I suffered from double typhoid for 42 days.

In 1938, while a servant was suffering from typhoid fever, I contracted the disease after caring for him. This was confirmed by Dr. Vandanam, who had come from Aleru to treat me.

To restore my health, my parents spent money as if it were water, sparing no expense. They faced countless hardships and emptied the house of all its wealth.

For two months, the illness gripped me and tormented me. During this ordeal, without realizing it, I would scream nonsensically—though they were not the cries of madness.

Instead, it was the Supreme Lord stirring within me, creating a tumult. This turmoil brought about great anguish, but it also led to revelations.

In that anguish, answers began to emerge to the questions I had pondered since my school days:
My life is like a living hell!
When I die, no one will follow me.
What will come with me?
Only the virtue I accumulate on this earth!

As the Lord proclaimed, “Whoever can leave behind spouse, children, parents, or home for the sake of the Kingdom of God will receive blessings in this life and eternal life in the next.”

The more these words shone before my eyes, the clearer it became to me: “Dying in the service of God alone leads to salvation.”

However, I questioned, “How can I atone for my terrible sins?” Reflecting on this in the midst of my typhoid fever, I arrived at a firm decision.

The storm that led me to this resolve was raging within me, known only to my heart and to no one else.

I call him “our” teacher because he baptized not only my grandfather and parents but also me. Benjamin garu, who played this pivotal role, often observed my struggles and spiritual yearning. He would approach me and comfort me, saying, “David, if you study in the seminary, you can become a great servant of God. I will talk to Doragaru and ensure you are sent there.”

However, I had no desire for this. For days, a conflict raged in my mind over Benjamin garu’s words.

What kind of service pleases God?
How can one attain salvation?

Could I earn God’s love by serving as an evangelist?
Or would ministering to the sick lead me to salvation?

I remembered someone telling me, “Not many of you should become teachers, knowing that we who teach will be judged more strictly.” This echoed in my mind until I realized it was from James 3:1 in the Bible.

From my childhood, I had a small but persistent desire, like a hidden spark among the leaves:

To serve the sick, earn the Lord’s blessings, and thereby attain salvation.

Given my family’s limited means, I aspired at least to become a compounder (medical assistant). If circumstances allowed, I dreamt of becoming a doctor. In those days, doctors held the highest position in society. I wanted to earn the name “Dr. K.R. David” by serving the sick in the regions of Janagama and Tanguturu.

But would circumstances permit it? For the four years I studied in high school, I tilled the mission compound fields, tended cattle, and paid my school fees with great difficulty. Now, with typhoid having drained my family of its resources, our house lies in ruin.

How can I ever become a doctor?

Based on the verse “I was sick, and you visited me” (Matthew 25:36), I concluded that God’s desire is for us to serve the sick, and that through such service, sins can be forgiven and salvation attained.

I firmly decided that nothing in this creation—whether nature or society itself—would hinder me from fulfilling the Creator’s will. With this determination, I deeply longed to become at least a compounder (medical assistant).

As if to confirm that the Lord approved of my desire, His immense grace brought healing to me in a miraculous way.

However, it took two months for me to regain my former strength.

After those two months, leaving behind everything—my home and family—I sought the path to salvation. With restored health and renewed effort, I decided to pursue a compounder course and set out for Hanamkonda to fulfill this aspiration.
