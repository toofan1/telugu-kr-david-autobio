Chapter 19

There was no need to see all the rice — just one grain was enough.
In that way, as soon as my mother saw Leelamma, who was as radiant as Devakanthala (heavenly beauty), she embraced her tightly.
Leelamma captured the hearts of my aunt and uncle right at the first meeting.
Our parents and relatives, in their devotional excitement over our marriage, dreamt many daydreams —
that regular service (to God) would decrease, and that we would become absorbed in worldly life.
But all those dreams were proved false.

Until then, it was solitary testimony; now it became joint testimony.
One flame of fire was joined by another flame of fire.

Through the bond of marriage, the joy of protection increased greatly.
When I was alone, God's call came for my service. But I could not sever myself.
There was sorrow that I was unable to serve the Lord completely.
But then I obtained a wife. Two stomachs must be filled.
On one side, the intensity of the spirit; on the other side, the intensity of hunger.

Who would provide? Who would support?
I laid the burden on the Lord, that doer and provider.

My job was still the same. Along with it, the teaching profession was continuing.

Getting down at Ghanapuram station with the new bride, we traveled in a cart
to Thimmapeta, which was about 5 miles away.
"Has our master come?" the Muslim boys and girls all gathered and welcomed me.

Along with Leelamma, to study under me,
my parents also sent my younger brother Jacob and my second sister Sharamma here.

Even while doing the teaching profession, the goal of my life was the Lord’s service.
Leelamma only ever increased the passion for the Lord’s service in me, never decreased it.

At that time, the political sky of India was thick with storms.
Breaking the chains of British imperialism,
tens, hundreds, thousands of youths were marching into prisons
shouting "Vande Mataram" (Hail Motherland).

On one side, Mahatma Gandhi was stirring up a satyagraha (nonviolent freedom movement);
on another side, Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose,
with intense passion, were stirring up the youth saying "If we die, glory; if we succeed, the kingdom."

Whenever I saw that great movement, my blood would boil.
Millions of people in India were ready for such sacrifices — for what?
For Swaraj (self-rule)?
For a momentary earthly kingdom?

Were thousands going to jail, facing beatings, gunshots, without counting the cost,
for just a temporary worldly kingdom?
Then, how much greater sacrifice must we make for the eternal divine kingdom?

The Kingdom of Jesus Christ — an everlasting kingdom!

In pursuit of that Kingdom, in past history, how many Christian warriors
made matchless sacrifices?
Did they not offer their lives as if they were blades of grass?
Did they not melt their hearts like candles and offer their souls?

Did they all only sacrifice when it was convenient?
I too, whenever possible, served along with Pastor P.M. Samuel and Brother Paranjyoti,
and these thoughts started to stir within me.

In ancient times, did not the Lord provide for the apostles?
Did not God feed three lakh (300,000) Israelites with manna
for forty years in the wilderness?

Is He not the nourisher of the whole universe, the creator of all the worlds?

Is He not trustworthy?
Would He not nourish our small family — just the two of us?

When we were ready to offer everything to His service,
those burdens became His burdens.

"No man can serve two masters," —
that word of the Lord entered into my experience.
I prayed to the Lord with determination,
asking for the fortune to bid farewell to my job and teaching profession,
to be used fully for His service.
And the Lord heard my prayer.

A new year came. On January 18th, the Lord separated both me and my family
for His service.
Using us wondrously in His service,
He gave me the fortune to follow the footsteps of apostles without salary or financial dependence.

Now my heart is overflowing.
There is courage in my heart.
There is complete faith.
In that faith, there is great strength.
I now have no fear of financial trouble.
Whatever obstacles come, they are like blades of grass to me.
Holding the banner of Christ,
the two of us, hand in hand,
traveled even to places untouched by air or light,
proclaiming the name of Christ.

To Him who bestowed such a blessing —
may praise be given forever!
