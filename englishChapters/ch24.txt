Chapter 24

December 21, 1942
Christmas is just four days away. At that auspicious time, “Evangelist” was born.

Birthplace - Gorre Kunta near Warangal.

The newborn was given the name with the expectation that she would become a great evangelist.

Though Evangelist was the second daughter, after “Grace” slept in the Lord, this one must be called our first daughter.

Only the parents can experience the joy of the birth of a child.

However, even though the child had been born for four months, I could not get the privilege to see the child and rejoice with my eyes.

I traveled from Guntur district to Warangal district, but I could not obtain that happiness.

I needed travel expenses. I was walking around with sentences to complete.
The distance from this place to Warangal by road is 178 miles.

How long could I wait without seeing the child and the mother who gave birth? Finally, I took a chance. I had an old bicycle. If it moved, it was fine; otherwise, it was stubborn, with worn-out tires that might break at any moment.

Even while walking, I was constantly worried about the tires, and with that same old bicycle, I started my journey. Somehow, I reached Vijayawada. Still, I had 158 miles to go to my destination.

At Vijayawada, I rested for a while and continued my journey with determination. With eagerness to see my beloved and the child, I pedaled 60 miles in one day, and reached Nelakondapalli. From Vijayawada via Kodad, Nelakondapalli is 60 miles, and at the village square, I arranged for food through a police constable and immediately continued on the bike. After having a light breakfast in Khammam, I continued my journey the entire night, and by 4 PM, I reached Warangal, passing through Torruru and Vardhanna Peta. From there, I reached Gorre Kunta village.

When I arrived, I met my wife, Leelamma, who was nursing the four-month-old baby. The joy in my heart burst into my eyes as tears of happiness fell, and I embraced both mother and child in joy.

Ah! No matter how much suffering we go through, in the end, the Lord can bring happiness to the lives of His servants and those who trust in Him. I praised the Lord who gave such a blessing.

Though my wife, Leelamma, went through many struggles, even staying months away from her husband in a distant place, she never faltered in her faith in God or in me. In such a sweet union, I only praised and prayed to God, trusting that the union would be fulfilled. We considered all the difficulties around us as blessings from God.

“Those who sow in tears will reap with joy,” as stated in Psalm 126:5, is the foundation of our faith.

When the Warangal congregation invited me, I decided to leave “Imani” and come to Warangal. Leelamma, who was prepared to serve in a distant place, also expressed happiness to stay in Warangal.

I left “Imani” and brought everything with me. In Warangal, Pastor T.K. Thomas appointed me as his assistant pastor, as there were no two pastors at any center. Warangal was the only place with such a situation, so I became the joint pastor with Pastor Thomas.

The gospel ministry in Warangal grew tremendously. We worked tirelessly, day and night, without rest or food, preaching the word.

Every morning, my wife Leelamma, carrying one bundle with the baby and another with the scriptures, would begin her ministry. Every day, she would follow me around, and we would travel all around Warangal town and surrounding villages, returning home by midnight or 1-2 AM. If food was found along the way, we considered it God’s grace.

During this time of service, the cholera epidemic spread rapidly in the village where we were staying, Mattewada. Even though we saw no rest in serving those affected by the disease, the cholera epidemic eventually reached our home.

One side, the baby Evangelist cried for her mother’s milk; on the other side, in her final moments, Leelamma suffered.

The vomiting and convulsions she endured, I held in my two hands and fed her.

"As for a man, he shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife" (Genesis 2:24). "And the two shall become one flesh" (Matthew 19:6). These words came true for us, and death was the only thing that could separate us, but no other pain could do so.

The Lord Himself, having overcome death in His resurrection, will not let death have power over those who follow Him. This is my faith.

Still, a man must fulfill his duties. Although no relatives or family members came, I took the responsibility of changing her clothes for three days.

In the end, Leelamma fell ill with cholera and came close to death. My only child, “Evangelist,” who was so dear to me, was about to become an orphan. Though I was troubled by this, I continued to pray for her healing, believing in the Lord’s power to restore her.

The Lord poured out His immense grace upon Leelamma, and she slowly began to recover. The Lord Jesus, the one who heals His servants, restored her health.

During that difficult time, I did not abandon my ministry.

I gave my testimony at the convention held in Uyur. From May 12 to 16, 1943, many people from various villages attended the convention between Vijayawada and Antarvedipalem. Along with pastors P.M. Samuel, P.P. Thomas, K.S. Joseph, P.L. Paranjyoti, and Miss P. Kamath, I also preached.

The messages we preached caused a great movement among non-Christians. At the end of the convention, 13 people were baptized, and many experienced a change of heart. After the convention ended, it rained, and I clearly remember how the Lord led us for five days without any obstacles.

After returning from Uyur to Warangal, cholera had entered Mattewada, so we moved to Anandaravugaru’s garden in Pappalagutta.

All the ministry activities were carried out from there.
