Chapter 39

During March 12–14, 1948, the Rajahmundry meetings were conducted in a manner delightful to the eyes. In these meetings there was one special distinction greater than in previous meetings.

Across the entire European continent—that is, in countries such as England, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and others—serving as the ambassador of the Pentecostal churches of the Telugu land, Apostle P. M. Samuel had carried out a gospel tour. Boarding an airplane at Oslo, the chief city of Norway, he visited Poland, Geneva, Rome, Greece, Palestine, and other countries, and returned to the homeland on January 18. On this occasion, a welcome felicitation meeting was included as part of the Rajahmundry meetings.

Not only that, but in view of his setting out once again on a tour to America during the months of April and May, a farewell was also extended to him.

Hundreds of people flocked to the meetings. Pastors Power (Madras) and A. J. Janu (Travancore) delivered stirring and encouraging messages in the meetings. I too ministered the Word of God.

Hindus, and even Christians belonging to other missions, attended in large numbers—hundreds in count. The Spirit-inspired words of the speakers pierced sharply into the inner chambers of the hearts of the audience.

As Pastor Samuel spoke of the details of his gospel journey across Europe, the meetings extolled him as a great ambassador who had brought intercontinental renown to the Telugu land.

Brother Samuel also implanted a great gospel message into the hearts of the listeners. And what was that?

When it was announced that from the month of June, Suvartha Prakaashini would be published from Rajahmundry city itself, and that Pastor K. R. David would take full responsibility as its director, editor, and overseer, joyous shouts erupted loudly. Everyone’s body thrilled with excitement at that news.
