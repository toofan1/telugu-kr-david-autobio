Chapter 25


1944 came. It brought even more revival to the Pentecostal movement.
In the town of Nellore, there was no Pentecostal branch at all.
Those who belonged to the “Church of God” branch, bowed their heads to the influence of the Holy Spirit present in the Pentecostal faith, and for the first time, from April 26-30, organized a Pentecostal meeting.
These meetings were held in Ramireddypet.
Pastor T. M. Abraham and Jeevaratnam garu organized these meetings.
Pastors P. M. Samuel, K. V. Kurian (Tiruvankur), Paranjyo, and others, and I too along with Brother Thomas from Warangal, attended and preached sermons.
The meetings progressed with revival.
The flames of the Holy Spirit shook the town of Nellore itself.
When I preached about the "Gospel Truth," many were astonished, asking, "Is there so much meaning in the Gospel?"

The next month — May.

In Rajahmundry, at Danavaipeta, in front of the house of Sri Janu Alangayya garu, under a tent that was set up, revival meetings were held.
To these meetings, Pentecostal representatives and others came from places such as Secunderabad, Vijayawada, Kakinada, and Narak (Narsapur).
In these meetings too, pastors Samuel, Thomas, Paranjyoti, Lukson, Darmadan, and I attended.
Sister Annamma Mammen also taught precious devotions.
Some sisters gave experiential testimonies and glorified God.

Dr. T. Yesudasu garu’s daughter, Dr. Mrs. M. J. Peter, greatly helped in conducting these meetings.

It was my very first time preaching at Rajahmundry.
My preaching brought new faith among many servants and introduced the Pentecostal truth directly.

In those days, misunderstandings such as "do not seek the Holy Spirit" arose.

The one who caused the misunderstanding was Mr. Fox.

I first encountered this through an article "Christians, Be Alert," published in Suvartha Prakashini.
When the Lord said (Luke 11:13) "Your Father in heaven will surely give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him," what value is there to the word of Fox, the editor of Christian Expectation?

After Christ’s ascension, on the day of Pentecost, did not 120 disciples receive the Holy Spirit?
After the Pentecost festival, six years later, when Peter and John prayed, did not the Samaritans receive the Holy Spirit?
After 27 years post-Pentecost, when Paul prayed, did not the Ephesians receive the Spirit?
In the last century, did not Moody pray and receive the Holy Spirit?
In our country, in 1905, was it not well-known across the world that 700 people at Pandita Ramabai’s ashram received the Holy Spirit?

Thus, by opposing the transformative Holy Spirit essential to the Pentecostal movement, Mr. Fox labored to extinguish the Pentecostal flames.
In that article, I warned Christians to resist such misunderstandings.

By God's grace, this warning bore fruit, and many were drawn into the Pentecostal movement.
(The Lord’s Word was confirmed to be a two-edged sword.
In literary terms, this article earned me a great reputation.)
