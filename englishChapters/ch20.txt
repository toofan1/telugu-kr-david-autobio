Chapter 20



The news that I had resigned from my job caused great astonishment everywhere.
"Such daring?" — all my relatives were utterly shocked.

Let the whole world think what it may!
With firm determination, and with my life companion’s full support, I came to this decision.

The Lord blessed our decision with His grace.
On Monday, March 24, 1941, at exactly 4:45 in the evening, in Warangal Civil Hospital,
my Leelamma gave birth to a daughter.
Since this firstborn was granted to us purely by God’s mercy,
we named her "Grace," meaning Krupa.

Thus the two of us became three.

Whatever else may be — the Lord Himself remained with us.

At that very time, the General Pentecostal Convention meetings were taking place at Islampet, Vijayawada.

Leelamma was still a frail new mother.

Straight from Warangal, we set out for the Lord’s work to attend the meetings at Vijayawada.

The Pentecostal fires had engulfed Vijayawada!
Through every street, triumphant shouts echoed;
processions marched;
the corners were resounding with Bible verses;
the uproar of Christ’s name rose higher and higher.
All of Islampet seemed to sway in the name of Jesus.
In such a charged atmosphere, the meetings commenced.

A pure, guileless brotherly love shone forth.
A mighty revival had broken out.
While the speakers preached in English and Malayalam,
Brother V.N. Lukeson, Pastor K.S. Joseph, P.L. Paranjyoti, and I translated those sermons into Telugu.

I considered this a great honor in my life.
My translations flowed with much zeal;
at every word, cries of "Hallelujah!" rose higher and higher.

Thus the meetings concluded.
Everyone else departed — only Leelamma, the baby, and I remained.

Under Pastor Samuel’s oversight, we now had to take care of all the household work.
Another Malayalam minister, K.J. David, was with me.

Both of us had to finish all the chores at home, and then set out for the ministry.
We had to visit every home and bear witness.

By that time, Pastor P. Anandam and Deenamma, who had been ministering at Vijayawada,
had been transferred to Bandar.
Sri P.L. Paranjyoti and his mother Neelavatamma were serving in Warangal.
Pastor P.T. Chacko had taken up responsibilities at Eluru.

Pastor P.M. Samuel and his family were living at Vijayawada.
We — K.R.D. and K.J.D. — served as assistants under him.

Already by then, the monthly magazine Suvartha Prakashini ("Gospel Light") had been launched.
Its editor was Pastor P.M. Samuel;
the associate editor was Sri P.L. Paranjyoti.

The magazine was being published through the Andhra Granthalaya (Printing Press).
I had to take charge of its responsibilities.

Editing the magazine was heavy work;
preaching the gospel day and night was heavy work too —
yet to me, immersed in Christ’s devotion, these were as light as tamarind pods.

It was in the August 1941 issue of that magazine that my testimony first appeared in print.

Taking the first step onto the path of Christian literature —
that was my story’s new beginning.

Without the support of Christian literature,
it would have been difficult for the name of Christ to be proclaimed so widely.
In my worldly life, there had always been a secret stream of literary aspiration flowing within me —
this was its first visible step.

How great was my joy standing on that first step!
Words cannot describe it.

Leaping and bounding like a boy,
I ran to share my happiness with my beloved Leelamma.

In that testimony, not only did I confess my past sins,
but I also declared that I had turned back to Christ,
thus glorifying His name.

"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners — of whom I am chief."

Yes, it is true!
He is the Savior.
To this world, entangled in all manner of sins,
He was the first to show the way of salvation.

Those who are baptized into Christ’s holy name —
all their sins are washed away.
