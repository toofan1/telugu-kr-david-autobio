Chapter 32

In the new year of 1947, the Lord blessed me even more and continued to use me in His service.

In the second week of January, the General Convention of the Indian Pentecostal Church of God was to be held at Kumbhavadu in Kerala.
For that meeting, Apostle P. M. Samuel selected four people to participate.
Among those four, I was one.
When the Lord, with His gracious hand, chose and sent me to the Kerala meetings, my heart overflowed with holy joy and excitement.

First, we traveled from Vijayawada to Madras, and stayed in the Pentecostal Church there.
From there we went and visited Tiruchinapalli and Tanjore.
In the Tamil region, our messages in Telugu were translated into Tamil.

The Tamil country was centuries ahead in the service of Christ.
With a desire that our sermons might become streams of revival in such a land, we sounded forth the Gospel message without restraint.

It was indeed on this Coromandel coast that Thomas, the disciple of Christ, set foot 52 years after Christ’s ascension, and manifested the power of Christ in ways that astonished many.
He preached the Gospel ceaselessly, without rest.

From there, we entered the land called Travancore, now Kerala.

Kerala — a land of great beauty, wherever you look, filled with lush coconut groves, appearing like a garden of paradise.

When the Apostle Thomas stepped on the Malabar coast of Kerala, many Hindus were standing in the rivers, performing evening rituals, drawing water with their small vessels and pouring it toward the sun, then sprinkling it upon themselves and others.

Thomas was astonished and asked them,
“Why are you doing this?”

They replied,
“If we sprinkle this water, all our sins are destroyed.”

Hearing this, Thomas was amazed.
With a desire to glorify Christ and remove the ignorance among them, he said to them:

“Let us find out whose God is the true God — the one you serve or the one I serve.”

The priests there asked,
“If you are defeated, what is the stake?”

Thomas said,
“When you draw water from the river with your vessel, a pit should form there.
And when you throw the water upward, it should stay suspended in the air.
If that happens, I too will serve the god you serve.
Otherwise, you must serve the God whom I serve.”

Both parties agreed.

The priests drew water with their vessels — no pit appeared, and when they threw the water upward, it did not remain suspended.

Yes, by the force of gravity, water that is thrown upward must fall back down —
but Thomas desired to demonstrate the divine power that could overcome the earth’s gravity.

Thomas drew water with his vessel — and while the priests looked on in astonishment, a pit formed there.
When he threw the water upward, it stood still in the air!
The power of God was displayed before them.

Then the priests began to worship Thomas himself as God.

But Thomas said,
“No, not so!
I am only a disciple of my Lord, the God who became man for the salvation of all mankind — Christ Jesus.
Follow Him, the One who by His sacrifice has taken away the sins of all men.
He is the living God who has risen again!”

Hearing this, all the Brahmins there became Christians.
Even King Thirumalachola was captivated by the power of Christ and became a Christian.

In that same envy and hatred, some Brahmins murdered Thomas in Madras.
In the year A.D. 68, that man of sacrifice, Thomas, became a martyr on Saint Thomas Mount.
Even today, for those who climb that hill, his streams of blood appear visible.

But his true gospel, like a forest fire, spread along the Malabar coast,
and within that early age itself, seven Christian congregations were established.

I touched such a holy coast.

There was no limit to my joy.

The General Convention began.
Pastor K. E. Abraham presided over the convention.
The convention had become famous for its revival sermons,
and the powerful preachers who had come there were well known for that.
As we were hearing those divine messages,
we felt as though the Lord Himself was walking among us—
we were filled with excitement.

Crowds filled with the Holy Spirit,
uttering praises and speaking in other tongues —
we truly experienced the Pentecostal experience
of the Acts of the Apostles in the first century.

Indeed, those great assemblies,
and the sound of the gospel flowing from them,
could make one forget even the roar of the sea.
Each preacher, as he rose to speak,
seemed to show forth Christ the Lord upon the blazing Calvary Cross,
shining with streams of blood.
Hearts melted;
on seeing that flow of blood and that vision of the Cross,
one could hardly restrain emotion.

Pastor K. E. Abraham, P. M. Samuel, P. M. Philip,
the Swedish devotee Swan, and Pastor Bills,
through their sermons, made Christ the Lord manifest—
to say so is no exaggeration.

Without any missionary divisions,
Christians from all missions attended those meetings.
Not only those who received salvation,
but even those who already had it—
the meeting grounds overflowed.

Kerala was ruled by Hindu kings,
but throughout that land, we could see Christian temples.
Even hundreds of years earlier,
Syrian Christians had built temples with towers and walls,
and established congregations
marked with cross symbols.
Seeing them, anyone would feel,
“This is truly a Christian land.”

To those early Christian brothers
who granted such a glorious position to the Christian congregations—
for their selfless, sincere labor and sacrificial ministry of the Word—
we cannot but offer our homage.

Natural beauty on one side,
spiritual joy on the other—
these two ran together like twin rivers in our hearts.

Their food — boiled rice with salt, dried fish, plantains,
and dishes cooked with coconut oil —
all these were strange and delightful experiences.

That same month was the Sabarimala pilgrimage.
Crying out “Harihara’s son, Ayyappa!”,
bus after bus was crowded with thousands of pilgrims.
To me it was surprising —
“How can Ayyappa, ‘Harihara’s son’, have two fathers?” I wondered —
but devotion is theirs.

We were devotees of Christ,
and bearing the banner of Christ,
we too boarded the buses along with thousands.
Though I cannot describe all the troubles of the journey,
we reached Thiruvananthapuram.
There, at the Hebron church, were meetings.

In those meetings, I gave my testimony —
how my Lord had blessed me in His service,
and when I spoke of a few bright incidents,
the listeners were amazed and became stronger in their faith in the Lord.

At that same time, Dr. T. Yesudas, who was in our group,
fell ill on the way.
In truth, the disease had already grown severe for him at Tiruchinapalli.
He suffered from asthma,
and in Kumbanadu, we feared greatly that he might die.

Somehow we gave up a few engagements,
lifted Dr. Yesudas,
placed him on the train, and reached Madras.
By then, his daughter Dr. M. J. Peters and son,
Mr. T. Y. Jonathan, railway station master,
met us at the Madras Central Station.
We handed their father back to them alive.

Even this, without doubt, was the grace, mercy, and glory of the Heavenly Father.
