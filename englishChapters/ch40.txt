Chapter 40

Although from January 1948 itself I had been serving as assistant editor of Suvartha Prakaashini, the June issue was one in which I fully discharged the responsibilities of editor.

For the fulfillment of the Lord’s promise, “You shall be witnesses unto Me even unto the ends of the earth,” the editors of Suvartha Prakaashini—Pastor P. M. Samuel, together with Pastor K. E. Abraham—set out on May 21 to board a ship at Colombo for a journey to America. For that reason, the magazine came entirely to Rajahmundry, and I assumed all responsibilities.

The Suvartha Prakaashini, which began in 1941, shone brightly with its own light. It spread the gospel even to the remotest corners of Andhra land, played a distinguished role in winning many souls, and greatly contributed to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon countless believers.

After eight years and five months, it came under my leadership. My mind was filled with thoughts about what kinds of changes would be good if the Lord were to use the magazine even more powerfully as an instrument.

For the propagation of any ideology, periodicals can function as powerful instruments. They can pierce straight into the hearts of the people. Such an instrument ought to be employed for the proclamation of the true gospel.

Among other Christian missions, a great uproar against me already existed. They said that I wield criticism sharply, cutting straight to the bone, smashing pots without restraint. If there was so much uproar merely because of the occasional articles I wrote while serving as assistant editor, how much greater would the uproar be now, if, as editor, I were to let my pen dance with criticism as before?

Be that as it may! I came to the firm conclusion that criticism must be sharp, and I also undertook several measures to bring out the magazine with an attractive format.

Accordingly, I prepared the June 1948 issue. I gave it an eye-catching cover title. I myself wrote the editorial. That editorial began with a reply to the editors of “Ravi.”

Since the Canadian Baptist brethren were repeatedly making the same accusation over and over—like saying, “Sing the same song again!”—I wrote that editorial sharply, in order to shut their mouths.

The Ravi magazine belongs to them! In its June 1948 issue, that magazine criticized brethren who have Pentecostal experience—both doctrinally and contextually.

What was that criticism?

“Wherever they go, they only divide churches,” they say!

Yes, division is inevitable; it is natural. Wherever Pentecostal evangelists go, they preach the full gospel in detail: that Christ is the Savior of sinners, the Physician who heals, the One who gives the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the coming King. When those who believe that teaching—though they may earlier have belonged to other missions—are ready to come into the Pentecostal movement, who can stop them?

Because the Roman Catholics did not agree to Martin Luther’s reforms, the Protestant movement began. Many Roman Catholics agreed and became Lutherans. Because the Church Mission did not accept the purification doctrines of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, the Methodist and Wesleyan missions arose. Because these missions, which believe in sprinkling baptism, did not accept immersion baptism, all who believed in baptism by immersion according to the Word separated from those missions and became Baptists. Likewise, because those missions did not accept truths such as the infilling of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, and the second coming of Christ, many are moving from those missions into the Pentecostal movement. Is this not natural? It is sheer folly to accuse discerning believers who accept the full gospel as “divisive.”

Another criticism!

They say that we frequently take up the prophetic books. That is true! Why is it that the Baptist brethren do not frequently teach from the prophetic books of the Bible? Have not reports come recently that theology professors are visiting their churches here and there and saying that the Bible is not fully inspired by the Spirit, and that it need not be taken as an authoritative book? From this it appears that they have arrived at the position that Christ has no divinity, was not born of a virgin, that miracles are all fabrications, that there is no second coming, and that there is no special power in the blood shed by Christ. This is utter deception. Rather than believing such words, it would be far better if they quickly recognized that the Holy Scriptures, granted by God for the salvation of mankind, are truth—from the first chapter, first verse of Genesis to the last chapter, last verse of Revelation—and that they were written by divine inspiration.

As for why we take up prophetic words, there is only one reason: “Blessed are those who read, and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep the things written in it” (Revelation 1:3), as the Holy Scripture itself proclaims.

Yet another criticism!

Perhaps under the illusion that if a lie is repeated loudly enough it will somehow become truth, they accuse us of not preaching the gospel among non-Christians! This is entirely false. I have already answered this in the past in response to Mr. Fox’s criticisms.
