Chapter 11

In Hanamkonda stands the famous Thousand Pillar Temple, a symbol of the golden age of the Kakatiya kings who ruled from Orugallu (Warangal) and reigned over Telugu lands.

But that temple is the creation of artisans, not the Creator. I am someone with the curiosity to know not just the creation, but the Creator Himself.

Having joined compounder training, I was also seeking the path to salvation gifted by the Creator.

Now, there is something important to mention. Did my parents approve of this training or not? My parents were simple, innocent people—so naïve that they believed anything that glittered was gold. They saw compounder training as a stepping-stone to a great career, blessed me, and sent me off.

The training lasted six months.

After completing the training, I began treating patients. I served them using Ayurvedic remedies that I knew.

I believed that this service was the path to salvation. I dedicated my entire life to this path.

In Warangal, my brother-in-law, Sri Kolluri Abraham, lived there. I would often meet him, and he would repeatedly ask me, “How long will you search for the path to salvation without securing your livelihood? It would be better to take up a job while continuing your quest for salvation.”

Indeed, how long could I continue offering free medical services to the sick without worrying about food and sustenance?

Eventually, my brother-in-law persuaded me and found me a position as an inspector in the Warangal Municipality.

They say a small spring emerges somewhere, grows into a stream, and flows through forests, mountains, and towns, winding its way until it merges with the vast ocean. Similarly, my life is flowing, winding from one turn to another. Who can say when it will finally merge into the infinite glory of the Supreme Lord?

Even while working as an inspector, I continue striving to serve and heal the sick.
