Chapter 22

In May 1942, in Moparru village of Gudivada Taluka, Pentecostal meetings were conducted under the leadership of Mr. Kote James. Pastors P. M. Samuel, P. L. Paranjyoti, and B. S. Lukeson participated, and my wife Leelamma and I also attended those meetings. Those meetings went on for four days. All those days, there was a shortage of water even for bathing. Only for important persons, like rationing, three pots of water were measured and given per person. For the others, there were no such provisions.

Afterwards, we came from those meetings to Gandigunta. By the next morning, Leelamma’s left eye had swollen. Doctors Yesu Dasu and Esther David treated it much, but it kept growing bigger and within a week’s time, it came to the danger of losing the eye. The eyeball itself burst.

Ah! What suffering, what distress! Among the five sense organs, the eye is said to be the most important — when such an eye is lost, how much sorrow any human would endure is beyond words.

But Leelamma did not forsake the Supreme Physician who promised, “I am the Lord who heals you.” She did not rely on medicines. Even while suffering, she did not grumble.

"Do not grumble! Some among them grumbled and were destroyed by the destroyer."
(1 Corinthians 10:10)

The reason the Israelites wandered for 40 years in the wilderness, and perished there, was this grumbling. In their great journey, they grumbled twelve times — at the Red Sea when enemies pursued, at Marah for water, in other places for meat, for hardships, and many other ways — thus bringing destruction upon themselves.

But even the slightest trace of such grumbling was not in my Leelamma. Even in troubles and losses, she was a devout woman who never allowed her mind to drift away from the Lord.

To such a devout woman — even to her husband, that is me — the Lord allowed blows in Gospel service: the loss of the beloved first daughter, the loss of an eye today.

Ah, what kind of tests the Lord appoints for His servants!
Maybe because true devotion is purified only through tests — thus these hardships!

Yet, no matter how many troubles came, we felt that they were only to make our Gospel life shine like gold refined by fire.

It is he who stands firm in troubles — he alone wins. Our lives proved this great truth.

Meanwhile, believers from "Eemani" village in Tenali Taluka of Guntur district invited Pastor P. M. Samuel and Paranjyoti to hold meetings. Accepting the invitation in faith, I too went along, and we conducted the meetings. In those meetings, observing the power of my sermons and the purity of life, the village believers made another request: to appoint the David couple (us) for service at "Eemani."

That request was accepted.

Thus, we both were sent to "Eemani."

In Guntur district, Tenali is famous for its turmeric crops and is called "Andhra Paris." In the same way, Guntur is called the heart of Andhra, and Tenali is locally called "Pothugadda."

At "Eemani," our dwelling was in a cattle shed — on one side were the animals, and on the other side, we lived, sharing life together.

Even for this, I did not feel distressed.

In such a cattle shed, the Savior of the whole world, who owns the earth washed by the four oceans, Jesus Christ, was born.
Thus, living in such a shed was a blessing to us.

But there was no food there.

The environment? It was entirely different for us. The villagers boasted, “Here the seed of Pentecostal truth will not sprout.” But their words were proven vain. Their boastings did not succeed.

The Lord’s Word is like a hammer that shatters rock. It is a double-edged sword. As we stepped into this work, very soon the full Gospel truth spread like quicksilver to places like Sattenapalli, Donakonda, Vinukonda, Narasaraopeta, Tenali, Repalle, Sajjavarrapalem, Pedapalem, Krapp, and so on. Churches were established.

At that time, from August 15, 1942, the elders decided to start the Simons Bible Schools at Antharvedipalem in East Godavari district for the first time.

Leelamma and I set out from "Eemani" as students to that school.

But on August 9, the Indian National Congress passed the "Quit India" resolution, causing a huge national revolution to erupt across India.

Due to the arrest of Gandhi, Nehru, and many other leaders by the government, the Indian youth rose like a tide, burning trains, setting fire to government offices and petrol tanks.

The whole of North India turned into a furnace of revolutionary fire.
Our Andhra heroes too showed no less in this August Movement — at Tenali town, they died heroically under police gunfire and proved it.

Thus, in the midst of such a tumultuous freedom struggle, our journey!

How to reach Antharvedipalem? No trains, no buses, not even bullock carts.

Seeing my anxiety, Leelamma, carrying a bundle on her head, said, “Come on! We have the legs given by God.” I too put a load on my head and set off. In that time of no travel facilities, the legs given by God were our only support.

From Eemani to Vijayawada, 20 miles. We walked, carrying luggage, walking and walking, until our tongues stuck from thirst.
Finally, God led us under a tree.
There was a nearby canal; we quenched our thirst with its water.
We rested there for some time.

Leelamma was heavily pregnant at that time!

It reminded me...

When Emperor Augustus issued a decree that every person must register in their place of birth, poor carpenter Joseph, placing heavy-laden Mary, fully pregnant, on a donkey, set off from Nazareth town to Bethlehem, seventy-five miles away.
The hardships faced by those holy couple on the road gave us a little encouragement.

Rising again, we continued the journey.
Coming to the Krishna riverbank, a devout man ferried us across in a boat. Finally, we reached Vijayawada and arrived at the station.

And the trains?

Nowhere — all halted due to the August Movement’s impact!
Travel was completely obstructed.

We lay down right on the platform, praying to the Lord, resting.
Leelamma placed her head on my lap, I leaned against the wall, and we took a nap. After some time, we woke and sat up.
Just like finding an oasis in the desert, good news reached our ears: a train was being run under police guard up to Gudivada.

Our lives were revived! We boarded that train. But it didn’t move — we prayed, prayed, and waited — finally, it started moving. We said “Praise God!”

We reached Gudivada. From there, via Bhimavaram, we reached Narsapuram.
That journey took one and a half days.

At the Narsapuram port, we saw a boat with its sail hoisted.
We sailed to Sakinetipalli port.
From there, we journeyed by bullock cart.
While traveling, the cart fell into a ditch and overturned.
I feared for Leelamma, who was pregnant.
But by God’s mercy, the danger passed.

Finally, we reached Konaseema, the jewel of East Godavari district, famous as a land of coconut groves, and our destination, Antharvedipalem.
