Chapter 29

A thunder-like news came from Tanguturu.

Though he had no opportunity for education himself,
my father, a hard-working man, made the education and progress of his children his highest aim.
He tightened his belt, gave up everything, and toiled day and night with resolve.

He was pushing a full cart loaded with grain.
It had to cross over the edge of the “Cheri well.”
The well was deep.
Like an expert warrior with a sword,
he had to skillfully maneuver the cart past the danger.

My father sat on the cart and began pushing.
Just as the cart reached the well,
the expected danger happened—
the edge of the well broke, and it (the cart) fell into the pit.

Then the cart, and the oxen, should have fallen into that pit along with my father—shouldn’t they?

But that didn’t happen.
The cart, which broke the edge, along with the oxen,
fell sideways into the adjacent path, just barely missing the danger.

Even now, when I recall that scene,
it still appears terrifying to me.

At that moment, I believe, the Lord stood with my father,
and with His invisible hand, pushed the cart and the oxen away from the pit and onto the path.
Otherwise, escaping that accident would have been impossible—right?

Let praise be given to the Lord who saved my father!
