Chapter 26


Date is not remembered.

But one day, a great cyclone broke out in Warangal. In the gardens of Anandarao where we were staying, there was a well. Branches of trees were breaking and falling into that well. We used to drink water from that well. Thinking that the water would get spoiled, when I was pulling out the tree branches from that well, suddenly a snake bit me. Moment by moment, its venom was spreading into my body. Between life and death, I was struggling.
Servants prayed for healing with anxiety. My life-partner, who is a gift of healing, prayed with tears and wailing.
"The prayer of faith shall save the sick," — this divine word became true for me.

The God who saved Daniel from the lions' den,
The God who brought Jonah alive out of the whale,
The God who raised Christ from the grave — that Supreme Father, through His grace and compassion, healed me.

That is the testimony!
The date: October 13, 1944.

At 3 o'clock in the early morning, Leelamma gave birth to a son.
Can the joy that a father feels when a son is born be described?

Leelamma, too, forgot the pains of childbirth and radiated a gentle smile because from her blood had arisen another child to serve Christ, and a successor to the family line had been born.

We named that son "Thomas."
Saint Thomas was the first who brought the banner of Christ to India.
He was a disciple of Christ, and because he doubted the risen Christ, the Lord Himself called Thomas:
"Thomas, come to Me,"
and asked him to touch and see, clearing his doubt.
Then he cried out, "My Lord and my God! I believe," at the feet of the Lord.
He confirmed the living reality of Christ — Thomas, who, appearing on the Coromandel Coast, visited places like Kerala and Chennai (Madras) and bore witness even unto death at St. Thomas Mount.

Such a great man's name we gave to my son.
To what extent that name can be justified, or what divine plan is hidden in it — who can say?

May the will of God be fulfilled!
