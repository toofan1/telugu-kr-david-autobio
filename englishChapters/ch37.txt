Chapter 37

Because I was constantly running to many places day after day to proclaim the Gospel, it was not possible for me to remain in any one place steadily and do ministry.

Especially in Pasivedala, ministry activities increased greatly.
The Pentecostal movement spread to all the surrounding villages.
There was not a single believer who would stay away without visiting Pasivedala regularly.

In such a situation, a shepherd who could stay permanently and minister was needed for Pasivedala.

At that time there was a worker named Jonnakooti Paul.
He was a young man, discharged from the military, and therefore I thought he could function with discipline.
He had experienced repentance through my ministry, had taken baptism, and while eating in the homes of believers, was serving as my helper.

I appointed him in Pasivedala.
The service of God continued brightly.
Nearly a hundred people became believers.
The church took on a great form, “like a building built upon a rock.”

Suddenly, Paul fell into sin by forming a relationship with a widow and fled.
In a community known as a holy church, in a church that had gained the reputation that God Himself was dwelling there—what a most dreadful and terrible scandal occurred!
The entire church was thrown into turmoil.
The believers were deeply shaken and crushed.

This was not merely a disgrace to the church—it was like cutting off its head.
What remedy was there for this sinful act?

Once, when such immorality occurred in the Corinthian church, the apostle Paul was greatly distressed and instructed that the immoral person be expelled from the church.
Because they did not do so, he wrote again:

“It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans… And you are proud! Should you not rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?” (1 Cor. 5:1–2)

And again he commanded:

“If anyone who calls himself a brother is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler, do not associate with such a person—do not even eat with him.” (1 Cor. 5:11)

Obeying the command of the apostle Paul and in order to protect the church, I expelled him from the congregation.

By doing so, despair and hopelessness were removed from the church.
The stain diminished.
That sin would not go unpunished—the Lord Himself caused that discipline to be carried out through me.
Everyone recognized that this was the Lord’s doing.

However, for Pasivedala, a full-time shepherd was still necessary to guard the church like the apple of the eye.
Considering him worthy as such a shepherd, I entrusted that noble position to brother M. Isaac.
The church once again began to progress smoothly.
