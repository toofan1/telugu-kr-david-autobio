Chapter 30


The year 1946 came.

The beginning of this year began with my literary effort.

My essay titled “Your sin shall overtake you” was published in the February 1946 issue of Suvartha Prakashini (“The Gospel Light”), and it opened the spiritual eyes of many.

This essay is the counsel that the man of God, Moses, spoke to the covetous two-and-a-half tribes of Israel, who, after forty years of wandering in the wilderness, had reached the borders of Canaan but chose to remain on this side.

Saul, who disobeyed the commandments of God and acted presumptuously, when sin overtook him, realized, “I have sinned.” (1 Samuel 15:30)

Achan, seeing the accursed things, hid them greedily, thinking all this was happening secretly. But the God whose eyes are like a flame of fire caught him because of his sin.

King David, though he prospered by the grace of God, could not escape from the consequence of his sin in the matter of Uriah’s wife. At last he confessed, “I have sinned.” (2 Samuel 12:13) But as punishment for his sin, he lost his son.

The prodigal son, having gone far from his father and committed every kind of sin, realized his sin and confessed, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,” and was taken back.

Judas Iscariot, realizing the sin of his betrayal, confessed his guilt, threw down the silver coins that were the price of his treachery, and hanged himself. (Matthew 27:4)

A certain man raised and nourished serpents, let them crawl over his body, and earned money showing them. In the end, that very serpent killed him.

In the same way, everyone who raises and nourishes sin will surely be punished by that very sin.

Only the Lord Christ, the Savior of sinners, can deliver you from your sins.
If you come near Him with a sincere heart and pray with repentance, it will be well with you!

This is the summary of that essay!

Again, in the month of May, another essay was published — titled “Who are the cursed?”
Thinking that it still has value even today, I quote it below.

So then, who are the cursed?

1. Those who make carved idols and worship them. (Deuteronomy 27:15)

2. Those who withhold grain — (black marketeers). (Proverbs 11:26)

3. The one who trusts in man and turns his heart away from the Lord. (Jeremiah 17:5)

4. Those who are hard-hearted. (Lamentations 3:6)

5. The deceiver who vows to the Lord and offers a corrupt thing. (Malachi 1:14)

6. Those who do not give a tenth (tithe) from their income. (Proverbs 3:8)

7. Those who do not visit Christ’s brethren (the godly), nor feed them when they are hungry, nor give them drink when they thirst, nor receive the stranger when they come, does not clothe them when they are naked,
and does not visit them when they are in prison —
such are those spoken of in (Matthew 25:40–45).

8. Those who cannot cease from sin, whose eyes are full of adultery, and whose hearts are trained in greed (2 Peter 2:14).


While all this was so, in June of 1946, the time of my wife’s delivery arrived.
At the same time, another fiery test came:
Pastor P. M. Samuel’s son, Brother Abraham Samuel, was studying at the Bhimavaram High School.
From there, a Transfer Certificate (T.C.) had to be brought so that he could be admitted into the Rajahmundry Training College.
If the T.C. did not arrive within a day or two, the seat would be lost.
What to do now?

My wife’s time of delivery was at hand.
With her were Evangelin and Thomas, both small children.
And the pastor, whom I deeply respected, had entrusted his own son into my care!

On one side, Leela’s labor pains were increasing.
On the other, the duty entrusted to me by my pastor, who was like a father to me!
Which was more important? Which less important?

She had given me her half-body; I had given her mine.
She, who had given her all for me — when I came home tired from service, she would not even drink a drop of water until I returned and prayed.
Such a faithful wife waiting for her husband.

But time was running fast.
At 5 o’clock in the evening, the cart to Bhimavaram would leave!

I was caught between the crossbars of a dilemma.

In her pain, my wife looked at me with eyes full of hope and asked,
“What will you do about me?”

Immediately, a thought struck my mind.
The immediate duty was toward my wife.

After speaking and praying, I arranged for Leelamma to be taken to Dr. M. J. Peters’s house in Mangalavarapupeta.

Then, remembering that the Lord Himself was the comforter and caretaker of Leelamma, I suppressed my sorrow in my heart, and rushed to Godavari station to catch the Bhimavaram train.

Though I was traveling in the train, my thoughts were all on Leelamma.
I laid her burden upon the Lord, and kept praying that she might have a safe delivery.

If my prayer were to be answered, would not the T.C. be ready as soon as I arrived?

The train reached Bhimavaram at 10 p.m.
Immediately I went to the house of Mr. B. N. Lukeson, at Bethanypet.

Brother B. N. Lukeson, though working in the Sub-Registrar’s office, was constantly active in the Lord’s service.
Not only I, but all believers in Andhra affectionately called him “Annayya” (elder brother).

Soon Mrs. Krupamma Lukeson came and opened the door, and warmly welcomed me inside.

It was now 10:30 at night.

She began to shower me with questions.

“Brother, are you well?”
“Is Sister well?”

What could I say?
How could I describe a woman’s distress before another woman?

Words did not come.
But I had to speak — for a Christian must not tell a lie, even for good.

So I had to say:
“Sister was not well; before leaving, as her pains had begun, I sent her to the doctor’s house. I came here for Abraham Samuel’s Transfer Certificate.”

2 blank pages here (midpoint of book binding, so intentional?)

Abraham was blessed because he made intercessory prayers — for Abimelech, for Ishmael, for the salvation of Sodom, and for the deliverance of Lot.

Though Job was overwhelmed and afflicted with unbearable sufferings, yet he made intercessory prayers for his three friends. Though they had greatly troubled him, he did not become envious.

In the same way, Moses made intercessory prayers to God for the forgiveness and help of the people, and prayed for the healing of his sister Miriam.

Samuel the prophet prayed for Saul and for the people of Israel.

David, Elijah, Elisha, Ezra, Nehemiah, and other Old Testament saints, as well as Paul, John, Epaphras, and other New Testament saints, prayed many times for others.
For this, our Savior Himself is the greatest example to us.

Whether we like it or not, we are fully bound (one hundred percent obliged) to make intercessory prayers for others.

For whom should we make intercessory prayers:

1. For all men. (1 Timothy 2:1; Ephesians 6:18)

2. For kings. (1 Timothy 2:2; Ezra 6:10)

3. For fellow believers. (James 5:16)

4. For God’s servants. (Romans 15:30; 2 Corinthians 1:11)

5. For enemies. (Matthew 5:44)

6. For the salvation of the Jews. (Genesis 12:3)

7. For the sick. (Matthew 25:34; James 5:14)

It was because Abraham Samuel interceded in that manner that I too believed that my wife Leela would have a safe delivery and give birth to a healthy baby girl.

Thus, our family was growing.
To this growing family, two young men joined us who were staying with us: Brother M. John, and Mr. P. E. Varghese, who was sent to us from Kerala.

This Varghese had been sent to learn the Telugu language.
The interesting thing is, while I was teaching him Telugu, I learned the Malayalam language from him.

By learning in this way, I gained in my life a friend of great value.

In those days, almost all the chief Pentecostal pastors of Andhra Pradesh were Malayalees.
Because I had learned that language, I had the privilege of translating the sermons of preachers who came from Kerala into Telugu.

In this way, the holy Lord gave me the opportunity to serve Him more brightly and to glorify His holy name.
The Lord who used this humble servant of His in such a manner is worthy of praise.

As my ministry was increasing day by day, in December 1946, I held great meetings in Malakapalli, in Kovvur taluk of West Godavari district, and began the works of ministry.
That was the beginning — the Lord’s work in Malakapalli.
It must be said that in these ministry activities, the residents of Malakapalli were greatly moved.
