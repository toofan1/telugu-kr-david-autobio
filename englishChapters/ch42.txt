Chapter 42

“Good brings forth good” — such a proverb indeed exists.

While my inner being was filled with joy that I had fulfilled my God-given duty in the Lord’s service by proclaiming the Full Gospel to the entire Christian world…

On Saturday, August 7, 1948, at 8 o’clock in the morning, our son Philip was born to us.

After another seven days passed, I heard news even more joyful than that.

On the occasion of August 15, the second Independence Day, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru exhorted all the people of India that it is the duty of Indians to move forward in pursuit of a radiant future.

That was the future of an earthly kingdom.

Far better than that is the gaining of the Kingdom of Heaven — that is an eternal kingdom.
Only in that eternal kingdom can eternal life be obtained for all humanity.

For the attainment of that heavenly kingdom, a Gospel sacrifice (campaign) began in the city of Rajahmundry.
From September 1 to the 28th, the Zion Bible School functioned with great revival power.
Renouncing worldly things, and serving in their respective congregations with faith, as well as those newly offering themselves for the Lord’s service — 80 students attended this school.

Pastors K. J. Philip, P. L. Paranjyothi, K. S. Joseph, brother P. E. Varghese, and myself served as instructors.

I taught an exposition on the epistle written by the apostle Paul to the Ephesians.
In it, I explained the bonds of relationship between Christ, the Church, and God, the blessings received by the Church through Christ, the spiritual experience, the great methods of service derived from it, and the mysteries underlying them.

After the school, from September 20 to October 3, great conventions were held.
The speakers, with the fullness of the Holy Spirit, proclaimed the incomparable glory of Christ with great power.
Pastor P. M. Philip (Kerala) preached for four days on the topic “What do you think about Christ?”
On the final day, six persons who repented and accepted Christ — I administered baptism to them in the waters of the Godavari River.

However, during this period of the school and the conventions, my Leelamma rendered tireless service.
From merely ten days after childbirth, she came, remaining as a nursing mother, and had to do all the work herself.
With unwavering determination, without sleep or proper food, she took upon herself the responsibility of organizing these meetings.
Had she not done so, it would have been extremely difficult to continue this great Gospel sacrifice that lasted for more than a month.
