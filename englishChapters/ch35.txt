Chapter 35

Kambalapeta was burnt down.

Mrs. Kamalamma’s old house was reduced to ashes.

“Pastor garu, we need a house, please vacate this one for us!” she pleaded.

True, she indeed had no house.
But then — where should we go? Again, it was a question without answer.

Life itself had become a question mark. In those months of April and May that year, the municipal officers announced that 3000 houses had been burnt.

Did not know what to do.
There was no one to whom we could tell and get any help.

Only the Lord, saying “I am with you,” was leading us step by step toward the power of His holy name. While we were passing the days with tearful prayers…

One day…

As the morning rays spread over the world, the Lord Himself awakened and inspired us. Immediately we arranged for a bullock cart, placed our belongings and books upon it, and went straight to the National School compound.

National School!

A school with a glorious past — in the days of the national movement, the lovers of education in the town, being dissatisfied with the British system of education, established this school to implement a national education plan that would encourage handcrafts.

Arriving at that school, we unloaded our belongings on the veranda of the first-grade classroom.

It is worth mentioning that this first-grade classroom was not fit for education.
Rats had completely dug it up.
Heaps of mud lay everywhere.
From the back came the stench of filthy drains.

On that classroom veranda was our dwelling.

There, kneeling, we prayed to the Lord.
With the permission of the school management, we hung cloths across the veranda and lived there with wife and children for six months — such was the miserable state that befell us.

When I recall the condition of my family life in those days, I feel there was no one poorer than I in this world.
Did God grant such a life to all those who serve the Lord?

Yes.  A candle melts away to give light to the world.
A seed dies in the soil so that a plant may be born.

That is why the Lord, while teaching His disciples on the Mount of Beatitudes, said:

“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
People do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”

In the same way, a servant of God must be willing to melt away like a candle to give light to the world — that is the true fulfillment of life.

We were living there bravely and quietly when a notice came from the school management:
“This veranda was given to you only temporarily. It is now obstructing the school’s work, so please vacate immediately.”

What else could we do?
If children’s education was being hindered, we could not refuse. The Lord Jesus Himself gave children a special and precious place in His heart.

In those days, the aluminum industry in Rajahmundry was flourishing.
Nearly 500 factories operated in the town, employing about 5,000 workers. The laborers earned good wages, and the owners made large profits. Throughout South India, Rajahmundry stood as a center for the aluminum trade.

Mr. A. L. Jonah too owned an aluminum casting company.
He cleared out one room of his workshop and gave it to us. But whenever the furnace was blown, ashes rose up and filled our room. In our bedding, our cooking pots, even in our food—everywhere there was only ash. In that ash-filled room we lived for six months.

Even while dwelling in that pit-like place, I wrote an article for Suvārta Prakāshini titled “That Sin.” It was published in the June 1947 issue.

The article explained:
Sin is nothing but disobeying the command and will of God, and fulfilling the will of Satan. In the beginning, Adam and Eve became sinners because they rejected God’s word and submitted to the serpent’s deceit. Thus they lost the garments of glory and became naked.
To do what God has forbidden, or to neglect what He has commanded—that is sin.
Sin originated with Satan and entered the world through Adam. Therefore, sin is universal. However righteous a man may be, though he commits no evil deed, he is still born in sin and is a sinner by nature.
Such a sinner needs a Redeemer.
And that Redeemer is the Holy Lord Jesus Christ alone.

If you wish to be freed from sin, you must first confess that you are a sinner (John 1:8).
Secondly, you must accept Christ as your Savior.
Thirdly, you must come to the feet of the Savior with a broken and contrite heart, confessing all your sins with tears.
If you do so, “He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

That was the essence of the article.

From this I concluded that, though I may be righteous, I am born in sin and remain a sinner; therefore I must continually wash away that sin in the flow of the Holy Spirit. And today, I have taken it as my duty to cleanse the sin that surrounds me.

Though I am caught in so many troubles, I take care that the work of God is never hindered.

Then came August 15 —
The great son of India, the noble statesman Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the flag of independence upon the Red Fort in Delhi.

After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British had gradually brought India under their control; and on that day, Pandit Nehru declared complete freedom from British bondage.

How many brave sons of India had shed their heart’s blood along the way for that freedom!
They offered their heads like garlands at the feet of Mother Bharati.
They dreamed countless dreams of building a free India — and that day, their dreams became reality.

On that first Independence Day, Pandit Nehru exhorted the people of India to march forward, striving for a radiant prosperity that would justify the hard-won freedom.

Another important principle enshrined in the new Constitution was the fundamental right of equal freedom for all religions, a right that men like Munni and others had long advocated through many proposed amendments.

That same year, while still residing there, I conducted Gospel meetings in Rajahmundry on October 16, 17, and 18.
The meetings were triumphant and full of revival. Many came from surrounding villages as well.
Pastor A. J. John and K. V. Kurien preached powerful messages.

On the final day, seven people received baptism — a true fruit of my ministry.

With prayers that the Lord might continue to use me mightily for the winning of many more souls, those meetings were concluded.
