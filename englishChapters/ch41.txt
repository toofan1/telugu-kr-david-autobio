Chapter 41

Because many have misunderstood and opposed the truth of the Full Gospel, for the past eleven years it has been burning within me like a volcano. In my testimony of experience as well as in my preaching of the Word, I have continually proclaimed the “Full Gospel.”

Often, whenever I teach concerning Christ, since even believers themselves urge me, saying, “Preach the gospel,” the thought of making the Full Gospel clearly understandable to everyone has been constantly revolving in my mind.

These thoughts that were within me were once again stirred up by “Ravi.” I came to the firm conclusion that the time has come to proclaim the truth of the Full Gospel, and that it should no longer be delayed in publication even in the slightest degree.

I realized that it is absolutely necessary for the Andhra Christian church, and for non-Christians as well, to manifest Jesus the Lord, who bears the Name above every name in heaven, on earth, and across the ages—a Name beyond comparison.

The foundational pillars of the Full Gospel, and the fourfold doctrines which are the very foundation of the Church of Christ, I published serially beginning with the August 1948 issue of Suvartha Prakaashini.

Later this was also published in book form. In my opinion, this is the first and most comprehensive book written in Telugu on this subject. With scriptural grounding and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, I explained this Full Gospel.

In the Bible, the word “gospel” appears in many places. The word “gospel” may consist of only three syllables, yet within it is contained the entire will of God concerning the three worlds. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the entire essence of the Bible itself is contained in that gospel. This gospel “is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Corinthians 1:18).

This gospel is filled with what God shows toward humanity—love, mercy, grace, and with what is given to humanity—salvation, healing, glory, the kingdom, gifts, and more.

There are four principles of this gospel. These fourfold principles, having four faces, shine light toward people of the four directions, inviting them to come toward it.

What are these four principles?

Jesus Christ saves sinners.

He heals the sick.

He gives the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

He is the coming King.

1. Jesus Christ saves sinners

Because many do not believe the truth that Jesus Christ is the Savior of sinners, they are falling into darkness and perishing. Even some Christians may be counted among those who do not believe this. Some may believe that He is the Savior of sinners, yet do not receive salvation.

Just once, turn the pages of the Bible and see what Matthew 1:21 says:

“He shall save His people from their sins; therefore His name shall be called Jesus.”
The word “Jesus” means “Savior.”

From the very moment that holy blood fell from the cross onto the earth, a plea for the redemption of all living beings began. That plea began calling the entire world to come toward the cross. The cross became the symbol of forgiveness; on that very cross the thief received the blessing of salvation; and that cross became the symbol of redemption.

After the death on the cross, trampling death within the grave itself: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners…” (1 Timothy 1:15).

Therefore, “…there is salvation in no other name; for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).

Thus Jesus Christ is the Savior of sinners. He saved Paul on the road to Damascus. The Samaritan woman at Jacob’s well was saved. Zacchaeus was saved when he received Jesus into his house. The Philippian jailer was saved that very night. And as time has rolled on and generations have passed, today millions upon millions have been saved and stand as living witnesses to the truth that Jesus is the Savior of sinners.

2. Jesus is the healer of the sick

Jesus is the One who heals the sick: “Jesus went about proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God… healing every disease and every sickness among the people… and they brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and He healed them” (Matthew 4:23–24).

Moreover, “He called His twelve disciples and gave them authority to cast out unclean spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness” (Matthew 10:1).

In the name of Jesus, which possesses incomparable power, there is healing. To separate healing from salvation is folly. Is this not the inner meaning of Isaiah 53:4–5: “Surely He has borne our sicknesses… and by His wounds we are healed”?


Therefore, if you are a person of faith who can take refuge in Jesus Christ as your Physician, His name alone can become the remover of all diseases.

3. Jesus is the giver of the baptism of the Holy Spirit

Jesus is the One who gives the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the divine Trinity. The Father sent His Son, through whom sinners were saved and became believers. For the victorious life of such believers, the One sent by the Son is the Holy Spirit.

Before His ascension into heaven, Jesus taught His disciples in detail concerning the Holy Spirit.
“You shall not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father which you have heard from Me. For John indeed baptized with water, but within a few days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 1:4).

As they waited in this manner, on the day of Pentecost, “suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance” (Acts 2:1–4).

Speaking in other tongues is the sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Believing in Christ itself is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Believing in Christ is one thing; receiving water baptism is another. The one who gives water baptism is the pastor; the One who gives Spirit baptism is Christ. Therefore, it is only by praying in the name of the Lord that receiving the Holy Spirit is possible.

“The Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him” (Acts 5:32) is to be received by waiting in obedience with prayer, like the 120 disciples, and by shining like the wise virgins who had oil in their lamps, staying alert and praying, awake for Christ the Bridegroom.

4. The coming King!

In both the Old and New Testaments there are many signs related to the second coming of Christ the Lord. While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately and asked Him about the signs of His coming and of the end of the age. Then the Lord spoke thus:

“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. Famine will rage with fury. The earth will split open. The heavens will shatter and meteor-showers will burst forth.

“Darkness will spread over the face of the earth. Fear-provoking upheavals will occur in the movements of the stars, the moon, and the sun. Stars will fall to the ground. Wrath will increase upon the people; their necks will be severed by swords, and streams of blood will flow like rivers. People will be taken captive by besiegers and will cry out in unbearable anguish.

“At the terrifying roar of disaster-born seas, people will scream aloud. As people become fearful and fainthearted over the calamities about to come upon the world, courage will melt away, minds will collapse, and thus the end of the age will come.

“Then…

“A golden-winged angel will sound a divine trumpet across the vast heavens, with blazing brilliance that shakes the whole earth. Then you will see the Son of Man coming in full power and glory, shining with splendor from every direction, seated upon radiant clouds. He will send His angels and gather His chosen ones from the four directions—you will see it.

“Just as you recognize the arrival of spring by seeing the fig tree sprout leaves, so also when these things take place, know that the kingdom of God is near. I declare to you that this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Ages may dissolve into the ocean of time; the heavens may perish; this earth itself may pass away—but My words will never pass away.”

Thus the Lord explained to His disciples the signs of His second coming.

“But of that day and that hour no one knows—neither the people, nor the angels of God, nor even the Son of Man—only My Father knows. Therefore be watchful and wait in readiness,” He warned.

His coming will be like lightning that flashes instantly from the east and spreads to the west!

Those who do not believe in this second coming are not Christians. Thus, this stands as the fourth principle of the Full Gospel.

Those who live with the blessed hope of the Lord’s second coming will be alert in their conduct and will be shaped into excellent servants.

Here James 5:7–8 stands as a guiding crown for all believers:

“Therefore, brothers, be patient until the coming of the Lord.
The coming of the Lord is near; therefore strengthen your hearts.”
