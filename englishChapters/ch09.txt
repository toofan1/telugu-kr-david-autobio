Chapter 9


It was the year 1932-33.

My elder brother, Abraham, who was studying at a boarding school, came home for the holidays.

Seeing my brother, my heart soared with joy. All my classmates had moved on to become teachers, taking up prestigious positions. My brother had also returned home, looking every bit like a teacher himself.

And me? Was my life destined to remain that of a rural farmer?

The month of June 1934 arrived. The arrangements were made for my brother to return to school. Tomorrow, he would continue his studies—it was his opportunity, his path.

While my thoughts churned with mixed feelings about education, I made some mistake. As a result, for three days, my father scolded me harshly, intensifying my inner turmoil.

This led me to a sense of frustration with life itself. It’s often these seemingly small events that bring about historical change; if they can influence history, how could they not bring transformation in one person’s life?

Didn’t the “greased cartridges” trigger the Great Indian Rebellion of 1857? Didn’t a small event lead David to become King? Similarly, what changes might this small incident bring in the life of this young David?

I made up my mind—I was determined to break free from farm work. Without discussing it with anyone, I began forming countless plans in my mind for my life’s path.

After dinner, I went to the well, lay down near the edge, and stared at the sky. My brother came and sat beside me, sharing advice and moral guidance until midnight.

“Brother, even if father scolds or reprimands you, it’s for your good! Don’t feel bad. Don’t leave the village or our parents to go far away. If we are not close by, the enemies may overpower father and seize our property. But if we’re here, our father will have strength.”

My wise brother continued speaking, and soon, my eyes closed, and I fell asleep.

Dawn was approaching, yet the first rooster had not yet crowed. I woke with a start, looked around, and saw that everyone was still asleep. My brother lay beside me, sleeping like a king. For him, morning meant another lucky day—fresh shoes, fine clothes, new outfits, and admission to boarding school awaited him.

What about my life? Hauling stones and working the water mill!

I woke up quietly and followed the plan that had been forming in my mind. Taking a shortcut through the forest, I reached Janagama by sunrise. The schoolchildren there were playing carefreely, unaware of life’s burdens.

I had left this same boarding school eight years ago. After all these years, I found my way back here. Yes, one should search for things where they were lost, not in a different place.

I went straight to stand before the gate of Rutherford Sir’s bungalow. Madam Stella came to the gate, and as soon as I saw her, I greeted her with a “Salaam, ma’am!”

She started questioning me in rapid succession.

“What do you want?”

“I want to study.”

“Which village are you from?”

“Tanguturu.”

“Your father’s name?”

“Ramayya. My elder brother Abraham studies at your school. I am David.”

“What grade do you want to join?”

“Fourth.”

Hearing my answer, she quickly went inside, brought out a note, and said, “Take this to the headmaster.”

I looked at the note, which read, “Please admit this David into the fourth grade.” Those words filled me with immense joy.

With deep gratitude, I thanked Madam Stella in my heart.

They admitted me into the fourth grade that day. It was a joyous day in my life.

Without asking questions like “Where is your record sheet? Where are your belongings, clothes? Who will pay your boarding fees?” they admitted me into the school. If that isn’t something to be thankful for, what is?

Once, my classmate Mr. G.V. Samuel became a teacher himself. Some others went on to pursue higher studies. Here I was, a rural student with nothing but the clothes on my back. Along with joy, a feeling of sadness accompanied me.

With that sadness weighing on me, I walked around.

In front of me was a beautiful, colorful garden, like an Eden full of plants in strange and vivid colors, surrounded by a tall wall. As a village boy, the environment felt delightful. Everything seemed new. Being admitted into this school without any questions was another happiness. My joy knew no bounds—I felt as if I had fallen into a basket full of sweets.

That evening—exactly at 4:30.

The search for the lost son was still underway.

My father, having searched all over the village, finally entered the Janagama Mission Compound, worried about where I might have gone or what might have happened to me.

When he arrived, I was watching the teachers and students play volleyball, sitting by the center post.

Suddenly, I caught sight of my father.

It felt like an electric current surged through my body. My heart raced, my thoughts froze, and I felt a mixture of sadness and fear at the same time.

With a tear-streaked face, my father extended his arms toward me, asking, "Why, son? Why are you here?"

In that gesture, the love of a father was evident. I, too, felt a pang of guilt at the tears in his eyes and replied, my face wet with tears, "To study."

"Don't, son! This is your elder brother's destiny. Come back home with me!" he pleaded.

But I did not give in to his pleas. Even the teachers tried to convince me, yet my decision remained firm.

In the end, he went to the market, bought new clothes, a bag, and gave me some money before leaving.

That was it—the story between my family and me came to a pause. My brother was there; I was here.
