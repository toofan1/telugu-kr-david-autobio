Chapter 13


When the Lord revealed my old life vividly to me, I worked hard to change it. As part of repentance for the wrongs I had committed, I reconciled with many people. I returned belongings to their rightful owners, sought their forgiveness, and made peace with those who were against me—both through letters and face-to-face meetings (Matthew 5:23-24).

One of the letters I wrote seeking forgiveness was to Rev. Rutherford. In that letter, I mentioned the experience of salvation I had received, which astonished him and prompted him to respond.

I wrote that letter on January 26, 1939. Below is Rev. Rutherford's reply to it:

"Dear Son, David,
Your letter dated the 26th has just reached me, and its contents have greatly astonished us. We are truly saddened to hear about your sins, but we are immensely glad to hear about your confession and your earnest efforts to correct those wrongs.

Without delay, rectify those transgressions as soon as possible and follow the path that leads to eternal life.

We hope to meet you soon and pray that you cleanse your old life completely, leaving nothing hidden from our Lord.

In Christ,
(Signed) C. Rutherford"


The Letter from Rev. Charles Rutherford

Rev. Charles Rutherford not only responded to my letter in such a way but also invited me and Mr. G.B. Samuel to the Janagam Church to share our testimony. Both high school students and adults alike were amazed at this new transformation and glorified God upon witnessing it.

My testimony brought significant spiritual awakening among our own pastors. Many exclaimed, "This is what repentance and salvation truly mean." Some even compared my experience to that of Sadhu Sundar Singh, marveling and expressing their joy in various ways.

This newfound life became a testament to God’s grace, stirring many hearts and inspiring a deeper devotion to the Lord.


Upon hearing my testimony, Rev. Rutherford was astonished and asked, "David! Will you be an evangelist spreading the Gospel across our entire mission field? I will arrange it just as you did yesterday."

He initially intended to assign me to a specific field. But what did Christ, the Lord, tell His disciples before His ascension?

"John baptized with water, but in a few days, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will be empowered to be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

As these words echoed in my ears, I felt compelled to share the Lord’s calling with Rev. Rutherford. I told him that as a disciple of Christ, I was called to spread His message and bear witness to Him to the ends of the earth.

Rev. Charles Rutherford

Rev. Rutherford was a dedicated servant of God, who worked with great sacrifice and devotion for the American Baptist mission. He accomplished numerous significant works, and under his leadership, the prestigious Princeton High School was established in Janagam, a project that cost nearly a lakh of rupees at the time. Considering the value today, the readers can only imagine the scale of it.

Such a great servant of God had a deep devotion, and it was by the grace of God that I was able to respond to his call. This was nothing but divine inspiration.
