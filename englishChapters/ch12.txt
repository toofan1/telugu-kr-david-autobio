Chapter 12


It was December 1938.

The town of Warangal was engulfed in the flames of the Pentecostal movement. Baptist leaders organized a few meetings and invited Pastor P.M. Samuel to speak at those gatherings. Pastor Samuel traveled from Vijayawada to Warangal with his family and conducted worship services in the Baptist Mission’s designated church building.

To translate his sermons, Brother P.L. Paranjyoti was also brought in from Vijayawada. At that time, Paranjyoti was just 18 years old.

As they preached, the Pentecostal movement spread like fresh water washing away the old, like a river in full spate overflowing its banks, and like tongues of fire consuming everything in its path.

To illustrate the rapid spread of this movement, one example suffices:

In its early days, many men and women were awestruck by the glory of Christ and joined the Pentecostal movement. In no time, even the textile mill workers of Warangal were captivated by Christ’s miraculous power. They contributed an entire month’s salary to the construction of a Pentecostal church.

With pure, local funds, a magnificent Pentecostal church was constructed in Warangal, renowned throughout India, at a cost of ₹1,20,000.

It is awe-inspiring to think of how many people, beating their chests and weeping rivers of tears, chose to follow Jesus. Numerous Hindus shattered their idols into pieces and joined this great Pentecostal revival that swept through the land.

It was Christmas time!

At that time, I had no deep understanding of Christmas. I didn’t know about the Pentecostal ideal of celebrating Christmas not as a mere festivity but as a sacred occasion. Curious about this new way of observing Christmas, I wanted to celebrate it. However, I had not a single penny in my hand to partake in or enjoy the joy of Christmas.

Ah, Lord! You touched me, exposed my sins, and blessed me with light, truth, and life. Lord, I lift my hands in prayer! It is said that You follow a devotee like a cow follows its calf. Just as You provided gold coins in loaves of bread and sent cheques in envelopes to others, now, here I stand empty-handed, O Lord! Will You not have mercy on me? Will You not grant me something to offer at Your feet?

Praying to the Lord, I headed to the municipal offices. As soon as my superior saw me, he greeted me warmly, saying, “Hello David! Why do you look so worn out today? Is it because it’s Christmas?” Noticing my plight, he kindly placed a small offering in my hands.

But truly, who can give anything to anyone? That officer’s hand was just an instrument, for it was the Lord Himself who had given to me! My joy knew no bounds. As I walked home with great happiness, the thought arose in me to set aside a tithe from this offering to give to the Lord.

However, the question was: to whom should I offer this tithe? Nearby were two missions with dedicated servants of God. One was an old and established mission where faith and devotion shone like a steady lamp. The other was vibrant and dazzling like the radiant sunlight—a Pentecostal mission. It was said that these Pentecostal missionaries received no salaries but lived entirely by faith in the Lord, walking in the footsteps of Christ. I was convinced that giving to them would be equivalent to giving to God.

I decided to give my tithe to the Pentecostals. However, instead of offering mere money, I bought some fruits with that amount and, accompanied by my cousin Kolluri Abraham, went to the Faith Home. The people there were overjoyed.

Later, on January 14, 1939, at the break of dawn, bathed in the warm rays of the sun, I, along with my cousin Abraham, returned to the Faith Home. As we arrived, Sister Mary welcomed us with open arms, saying, “Come in! Let us pray.”

Inside the Faith Home, it was just the two of us, along with two others—Brother Paranjyoti and his mother, Neelavathamma. At that time, I was 22 years old.

We began to pray. Within 10 to 15 minutes, the prayer hall was filled with a heavenly atmosphere of worship and praise. In the midst of it all, the Lord Himself, the Eternal One, lifted His gentle hands toward us…


It felt as though the Lord Himself was blessing us. His divine presence enveloped us, and it could only be described as a vision of grace. A radiant light dazzled my eyes, and the Lord touched me, revealing the sins and deceit I had committed since I became aware of right and wrong. One by one, they appeared vividly before my eyes. He made it clear to me that eternal damnation awaited me unless I turned to Him.

I was shown a glimpse of what that damnation entailed—a terrifying, vivid vision of hell. The Holy Spirit worked deeply within me, and soon the burden of impending judgment weighed heavily on my soul. I had no peace of mind. My pride and youthful arrogance were shattered, leaving me face-to-face with the gravity of my sins. I was overwhelmed by the question: Who will save me from this dreadful fate?

In despair, I lamented, “Woe is me! How wretched I am!” Beating my chest, I wept bitterly, tears streaming down my face without end. The prayer gathering turned into a time of heartfelt mourning.

For eleven days, I was tormented by the weight of my sins—a sorrow far greater than any grief over worldly loss. My mind was consumed by a singular thought: How can I find salvation? I devoted myself to prayer and fasting, and gradually, I felt a sense of relief. The heavy clouds that had overshadowed my spirit began to part, letting in a new light.

On the eleventh day, January 25, 1939, the storm within me ceased. The Lord spoke to me directly through 1 John 1:9:

"My son David, your sins are forgiven. From this day forward, you are my child. Do not be afraid."

Oh, the joy of that moment of salvation! It is a memory I will cherish for eternity. My entire being was filled with an indescribable sense of awe and wonder. My heart overflowed with gratitude, and spontaneously, songs of praise poured from my lips in unending streams.


"I waited patiently for the Lord; He turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, and set my feet on a rock, giving me a firm place to stand." — Psalm 40:1-3.

These words have literally come true in my experience. Praise be to God!
