Chapter 45

With intense ministry activities, the New Year 1950 began.
No sooner had the New Year meeting in Rajahmundry concluded than, on that very day, I set out on a journey to Pasivedala.
My mind was filled with thoughts.
How would the construction of the prayer hall in Rajahmundry take place?
I placed the burden of climbing this step in God’s service entirely upon the Lord Himself.
Having placed it there, I did not slacken my daily ministry activities.

Leaving my Leelamma and the children alone in Rajahmundry, I went to Ventragada, and from there reached Chinagudem “Faith Home”, where I participated in the meeting.
In that meeting, I preached on “Zacchaeus” from Luke 19:1–10.

When Jesus entered the city of Jericho, crowds were pressing in great numbers, eager to see that great One.
Zacchaeus also, being short in stature, longed eagerly to see the Lord, but he was unable to do so.
The Lord Himself noticed the curiosity of the chief tax collector, stayed at his house of His own accord, and granted the blessing of salvation to Zacchaeus.
As a result, a great change came over Zacchaeus.
He promised the Lord that if he had taken anything unjustly, he would repay it fourfold.
When I preached in that meeting about this fortunate Zacchaeus who experienced such gracious mercy of the Lord, the believers greatly appreciated the message.

Later, I attended Bible study classes held in Machilipatnam.
At these classes, P. M. Samuel, P. L. Paranjyothi, and others were also present.
At the request of the students, I once again preached on “Zacchaeus.”
On the final day, I personally administered baptism to four believers.

From there, I returned to Rajahmundry, attended to the house, my wife, and the matters concerning the construction of the prayer hall, and that same night conducted a meeting in Kambalapeta.

The very next day, I set out for Tanguturu.

In Tanguturu—
That night, that is, on January 19—

A family worship was in progress.
Songs were being sung and the Word was being shared, when suddenly—
the sound of a gunshot!

Where faith exists, there is love;
where love exists, there is peace;
where peace exists, there is blessing;
where blessing exists, there is God;
and where God exists, there is no lack—
amid such a believing family, what was this gunshot sound?

Who fired a gun into the inner depths of our hearts, which were immersed in divine worship with crystal-pure hearts, and created fear and agitation?

Our brother Abraham immediately rose and ran toward the direction from which the sound came.
We finished our prayer and waited for the news he would bring.

And the news did come.

It was a Razakar attack.

In those days, Razakars had spread throughout Telangana.
By attacking Hindu families, looting, and creating terror, their aim was to force people into submission to their commands.
The people were becoming awakened and were resisting their atrocities.
In such resistance, our Jangam region stood at the forefront.
Though some were sacrificed to their brutality, their final judgment was nothing but a sentence of death.

In such an atmosphere, after spending six days among my family, I reached Rajahmundry.

I immersed myself in having the plans for the prayer hall drawn up.
I was moving about actively for its construction.
On one hand, I continued spreading the light of the Gospel in places such as Dhavaleshwaram, Divanucheruvu, Nandamuru, Kumaradevam, and other areas;
on the other hand, throughout the town—namely Kambalapeta, Aryapuram, Railway Quarters, Cemetery Peta, and other localities—
sermons and evangelistic journeys were being conducted.
I was receiving help from many people.

At the same time, that is, in the month of March, Pentecostal meetings in Vijayawada were held with a revival never seen before.
Three Swedish preachers participated in those meetings.
Seeing those meetings, they were astonished.
On the final day, 75 people received baptism.
Never before had so many people been baptized at one time.

Pastor Paranjyothi, P. T. Chacko, and I administered baptism to them.
