Chapter 14

The Pentecostal movement is being revived through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

I am waiting for such an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

Based on the circumstances, it seems the time is drawing near.

The entire town of Warangal is being shaken by the storm of the Pentecostal movement.

The Lord has been mightily using Pastor P.M. Samuel and P.L. Paranjyothi. Bold and fearless, like lions that have escaped their cages, they preach with roaring voices that dispel darkness. The Holy Spirit is manifesting in action. Even hardened criminals, known for their brutality, are having a change of heart, repenting, and surrendering their weapons in the presence of the Lord.

All these events are happening right before our eyes.

In those days, there was no separation between the Lord and us; we lived as one, filled with great joy. We experienced eternal life in action. Those who observed our way of life came to believe that there is no greater blessing than the gift of salvation.

Like Paul, who boldly preached the path of salvation through Jesus in Athens amidst thousands of idols, our sermons continued in the same spirit.

Paul, who demonstrated that it is not impossible to walk like Christ, often came to our minds as an inspiration. Following his example, we also became accustomed to mental discipline in walking that path.

How can I describe that sweet life?

As a result, on February 17, 1939, in Warangal Fort (in the water of the nearby moat), I, along with a group of many others, received baptism for the first time. Earlier, in my childhood, without understanding what repentance and new birth meant, I had taken baptism in Sharajupet. At that time, I had no idea what true repentance for sin was.

But today, after experiencing repentance, a transformed heart, and unity with Christ in my life, I have received baptism.

After baptism, according to the new apostolic teaching, we began to seek and pray for the infilling of the Holy Spirit.

The Lord was gracious. He began to fill us with His Holy Spirit. As He filled us, I started speaking in other tongues.

What? A Telugu boy speaking in other tongues? It may seem strange.

Yes, it is true! It is indeed strange! The operation of the Holy Spirit itself is a mystery. For those who have experienced it, for those who have bathed in the ocean of God's glory, and for those who have immersed themselves in that spiritual ecstasy, it is real. To outsiders, however, it seems like a peculiar phenomenon.

Even while traveling to work on my bicycle, I would speak in other tongues.

In this way, my life took a new turn. This was an extraordinary and miraculous milestone in my life!
